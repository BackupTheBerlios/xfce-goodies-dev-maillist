Subject: New plugin: Timer and updates to XMMS plugin
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0512011448540.1267@zeno3.math.washington.edu>

   Hi,

   I committed the changes to the XMMS plugin and imported the timer plugin 
tree into xfce-goodies SVN repository. Both versions require 4.4 panels. 
I'll release packages when XFCE 4.4 is released. You can also use the 
packages I sent to this list in November.

I have an emacs window with a long window title. The taskbar plugin does not cut
off the label. Instead, it overlaps with the next label/icon. Other programs
don't seem to have this problem. 

Apps I am running: Firefox, gnome-terminal, Thunar, emacs, leafpad, Synaptic,
links2 -g. I manage to make the window titles long enough for all other apps,
but emacs seems to be the only to cause problem.

Actually links as well, I later found out. Hmm, looks like the gtk programs
don't have this problem.

Well, you don't have libxfce4panel from svn ;-)

try to use xfce4-mount-plugin-0.3 from berlios
(http://download.berlios.de/xfce-goodies/xfce4-mount-plugin-0.3.2.tar.bz2) or a prepackaged version if available.

at berlios or svn, always look at the comments and notes at first to
find out whether it already requires the new 4.3/4.4 panel.

same will apply if you try to build the current svn panel.

Subject: New Plugin: lua-graph
Message-ID: <43A70FFD.3080308@gmail.com>

Hello,

(a bit of a long story, with a question at the end...)

I've written a new plugin, called Lua-Graph.
This plugin is a generic Lua-host plugin, which allows a Lua script to 
set the plugin's content.

With this plugin, you have quick & dirty solution for monitoring any 
kind of data on your computer, until a fully-fledged dedicated plugin is 
available.

Explanation:
Lua (http://www.lua.org) is a light-weight programming language designed 
for extending applications.
the Lua library is GPLed, ANSI compatible, very portable and easy to use.

Lua scripts for this plugin should have two functions:
"init" will be called when the plugin loads, and will create labels and 
progress bars.
"update" will be called once every second, and will update the label's 
text and the progress bar's value and colors.


First example: the following Lua-script makes the plugin monitor my 
computer's temperature (temperature is displayed as a number on the Xfce 
panel)
------begin temperature script -----
function init()
    add_label("lbl", "0");
end

function update()
    value = 
read_numeric_value_from_file("/proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THM0/temperature","temperature");
    set_label_text( "lbl", string.format("%d c",value))
end
------ end temperature script -----

As you can see, updating the text is very easy...
"add_label" and "set_label_text" are two plugin functions that create a 
label on the Xfce-panel, and update the label's text.

Second Example:
Read Battery level and AC state (only later I found out there's an 
'xfce-battery' plugin...)
------begin Battery script ------

function init()
    add_label("lbl", "");
    add_progressbar("prg",0,0,0);
   
    max_bat_charge = 
read_numeric_value_from_file("/proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/info","last full 
capacity");
end

function update()
    local current_charge = 
read_numeric_value_from_file("/proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state","remaining 
capacity");
       
    local ac = read_line_from_file("/proc/acpi/ac_adapter/AC/state");
    local i = string.find(ac,"on");
   
    local state = "<span background=\"#FF009D\">BAT</span>" ;
    if i ~= nil then
        state = "AC";
    end;
   
    percent = current_charge*100/max_bat_charge;
    set_label_text( "lbl", state .. "\n" ..string.format("%d%%", percent)) ;
    set_progress_bar_value( "prg", percent ) ;
    set_progress_bar_color( "prg", get_status_color(percent) ) ;
end

----- end battery script -----
The above script read the AC status, and when I'm running on batteries, 
displays "BAT" with a pinkish background.
It also displays the battery charge (as percentage), and a colored 
progress bar.


And now, my (very technical) question:
In order to compile the plugin, I need the "Lua" shared library.
The "C" source uses
    #include <lua50/lua.h>
    #include <lua50/lualib.h>
and the linking phase requires
    LDFLAGS += -llua50 -llualib50

It works on my computer (because I have the "lua-dev" installed, after I 
manually added the "LDFLAGS" to the "Makefile").
But how do I make the "configure" script check for the existence of "Lua" ?
The whole gnu build process it a bit confusing... (automake, autoconf, 
m4 ??)
I guess I should add "AC_CHECK_HEADER(lua50.h)" somewhere, but I don't 
know where, and how to re-create everything (simply running "autoconf" 
did not work).

Thank you for your help.

If anyone is interested in this plugin, I'll be happy to send it, or 
upload it to the Xfce-Goodies project.


Gordon.

Hmm, very technical, yes. Lots of us use xfce4-dev-tools for that kind of things. 
Perhaps having a look at the other plugins can help.
Also, it makes me asking one thing: does your plugin work with the 4.2.x version of the panel?
Because some things have changed since for the upcoming 4.4 version of the panel. (but don't worry, the port 
is not very hard to do).

For Sure, you're welcome. Just get an account on berlios and then the projects leaders can add you to the project.

Ps: Since I'm currently rewritting a little the site in order to add some sections, I'll be happy to post a news
to wish you welcome. No objections?

Subject: Adding support for ASUS Z71v laptop batteries to xfce4-battery
Message-ID: <20051220060336.GA90472@lizella.net>

Hello,

I just joined his mailing list in hopes that you can help me solve a
problem I'm having with the xfce-battery-plugin. I have an ASUS Z71v
which has two batteries in it. Status for neither battery is reported
by the applet and seems to default to saying the battery is dead, but
on AC charge.

I have attempted to compile the software with --enable-debug=3D"yes|full"
and in either case it fails to compile, stating that some variables are
defined but not used.  I am unsure if that error message is important
or not, but as the software compiles successfully without that message,
I have elected not to include it.

The information regarding battery state can be found in the files:

  /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state
  /proc/acpi/battery/BAT1/state

IIUC, the norm is for this information to be stored in the files:

  /proc/acpi/battery/[0-9]/state
  /proc/acpi/battery/[0-9]/status

I can only assume that the "BAT" prefix is causing the plugin to fail
to find the state file from what I've gathered from the code I've
looked over.

I have absolutely no real programming skill (some bash scripting,
trying to teach myself some C) and would like to add support for my
batteries to this applet. From what I've gathered with my meager
code-reading skills, the following lines in libacpi.c try to get an
integer count of the batteries under /proc/acpi/battery and then use
that integer value to locate the state file.

<snip>

1    /* now enumerate batteries */
2    batt_count =3D 0;
3    battdir =3D opendir ("/proc/acpi/battery");
4    if (battdir =3D=3D 0)
5    {
6  #ifdef DEBUG
7  	  printf("DBG:No battery. /proc/acpi/battery not found!\n");
8  #endif
9      return 2;
10   }
11   while ((batt =3D readdir (battdir)))
12   {
13     name =3D batt->d_name;
14=20
15     /* skip . and .. */
16     if (!strncmp (".", name, 1) || !strncmp ("..", name, 2)) continue;
17    =20
18     sprintf (batteries[batt_count], "/proc/acpi/battery/%s/state", name);
19     if (!(acpi =3D fopen (batteries[batt_count], "r"))) {
20        sprintf (batteries[batt_count], "/proc/acpi/battery/%s/status", n=
ame);
21     }
22     else fclose (acpi);
23    =20
24 #if 0   =20
25     if (!(acpi =3D fopen ("/proc/acpi/battery/1/status", "r")))
26 	    sprintf (batteries[batt_count], "/proc/acpi/battery/%s/state", name=
);
27     else
28 	    sprintf (batteries[batt_count], "/proc/acpi/battery/%s/status", nam=
e);
29 #endif   =20

</snip>


Thanks for your time and attention.  I'd really like to help to get
this working, both to have proper battery monitoring in everyone's
favorite cholestorel free DE, and to maybe learn a thing or two about
C. I regret that I am not able to write a patch myself for submission.

I'm using debian/testing, so the current version of xfce4-everything is 4.2.
Therefore:
1. will 'xfce4-dev-tools' work with debian's version 4.2 ?
2. There's no 'xfce4-dev-tools' as a debian package. Can I download the 
'xfce4-dev-tools' from its website, and it will work with debian's xfce4 ?
3. The panel is 4.2, but I've based my plugin on Wit Wilinski's 
megahertz plugin, so I hope it is pretty standard and easy to port.

No objections, of course.

Downloading the source and installing them must work. There must not be any packages in debian-testing for that
because it hasn't been realised yet.

Just a little thing: If you want to port your plugin to the next version of the panel, 
you will also need too install some libs from the xfce svn. But as I said, the port itself is not
too hard. Also nothing is urgent since 4.4 will not be there before 2 or 3 month (perhaps more).

I've added you to the project. I will also create a svn branche for your plugin, so you can upload your files in.
I will call this 'xfce4-lua-graph-plugin', so its name will be in the same format than for the other plugins.
You must also be able to realise files if you want. You can refer to the doc available on berlios for most of these 
tasks.

This is a change in behaviour in the latest Gtk versions. If you update to the
latest Xfce release it will be fixed.

I'm fairly certain that this is because newer Gtk version take this value from
the locale settings and don't allow the developer to set it manually.

Subject: Lua-Graph plugin released
Message-ID: <43AD571B.9000608@gmail.com>

Happy Holidays everyone,

Version 0.1 of the Lua-Graph plugin has been released.

You can download it at
  http://download.berlios.de/xfce-goodies/xfce4-lua-graph-plugin-0.1.tar.gz
or with SVN:
  svn checkout 
svn://svn.berlios.de/xfce-goodies/xfce4-lua-graph-plugin/trunk

I would like to thank Masse Nicolas for his invaluable help in getting 
this done!

Lua-Graph is a Lua driven plugin for the xfce4 panel.
It provides a quick solution for displaying any kind of information on 
the xfce4 panel.

See the "README" file for more explanations and detailed examples.

Comments and feedback are of course welcomed.


Gordon.

I confirmed it on the web gtk+2 manual.
Then, I think that it is more reasonable to remove this option "Week day starts
on Monday".

If there is no objection, I will close this bug and remove this option.

Subject: system-load-plugin 0.3.6 shows wrong free memory in 64bit linux
Message-ID: <43B4D6A2.8070800@arcor.de>

I'm using Archlinux 64bit and run Xfce 4.2.3.2 with the latest plugin
xfce-system-load-plugin 0.3.6.

I'm getting a strange output of free memory. the plugin shows right now:
2805MB used memory
and the output from free -m is:

 free -m
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:          3016       2988         27          0        803        182
-/+ buffers/cache:       2002       1013
Swap:          235          0        235


So I guess it shows the amount of real free memory 2002MB + used buffers
803MB. Should that be right?

And as I remember I hadn't this behavoir in archlinux 32bit.
