Hey,

I released a new version of the xfce4-notes plugin. Should be able to get  
it off berlios.de

Cheers,

Hello:

Notes on top is a really annoying feature !!!! Well, what is annoying is 
that it is hardcoded. User cannot configure this behaviour!

I've uninstalled notes plugin waiting for a new version.

cheers

If I uninstalled every piece of software because of unwanted  
features/behaviour, I wouldn't be running any software...

Anyway, you got what you wanted, get it at berlios.de

Let me know if there are other request or unwanted features, and I'll see  
what I can do...

  Hi,

  I posted a timer plugin to this list at the beginning of September, 
asking for testers, but no one has replied yet. It's of the same sort. You 
set an alarm time specified as a countdown period or time of the day. The 
alarm can be a popup window or running a commmand specified. The bug left 
was the adjustment of the size of the ctrl->base window (it was too big), 
but I believe the functions in the 4.4 API will let us handle that.

  You can get it from

  www.math.washington.edu/~kieroglu/xfce-timer-0.2.tar.bz2

well, that's quite fine - but I can't look at it as I'm now running the
new panel. So either of us will have to port it.

did you already look at the glade file for the options dialog?

why didn't you create an svn repository and project at berlios?

do you want to merge our efforts?

bye, fabian

   I don't have the new panel installed yet. I'll try to get it soon.

   Yes I checked that.

   Actually I was waiting for an invitation/permission from a developer. 
I'm the maintainer of the xmms plugin also, thus have svn access for it, 
but still I didn't want to do anything on my own.

> do you want to merge our efforts?

   That's fine for me. I don't know how much effort is required to do 
merging. You can take a quick glance at my plugin's sources. It's 
commented, so you can follow what's going on. If you think it will be 
reasonably easy to merge, then let's go for it.

you'll have to, as soon as you have yuor account, noone will do your
job ;)

svn import your_timer_tree \
svn+ssh://name at svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/xfce-goodies/new_repository

don't forget to checkout his repository before making any further
changes as the module will not be checked out when you import it
(ridiculously bad behaviour of svn).

I saw your post about the plugin, but I guess I didn't realize you were 
waiting for some moral support ;-) Sorry about that.

So, at last, please go ahead and import it. Sounds like an interesting 
addition.

	You are right ... ;-)

	I uninstalled the last version of notes because I was unable to
work with so many notes in front of my terminals...

   I don't want anyone to do my job. I just didn't want to make an untested 
piece of software a part of a project which is not run by me, solely based 
on my decision. If you say it's OK, I'll upload it. Unfortunately I'll be 
without internet at home for a few days, hopefully I'll do that next week. 
Sorry for the delay,

I ported diskperf and genmon plugins for Roger Seguin. Here's the

permission of the maintainer.

Does anybody know where I can find the updated clipman plugin? The link

leads to a 404...

Well you can find it on my PC :-). I've contacted the developer of
the "old plugin" but he has not responded yet because he it very busy.

I removed the download because it's rude to copy a project and release it
with an other name.
Till then i don't know what to do with it, so you'll have to wait.

Hey Harold,

I pressured Nick to give the tarball to me ;-) Now it's available at 
http://www.xfce.org/~jasper/plugins/ . These plugins are unofficial and 
not approved by their maintainers. Not all of them anyway.

cheers,

Message-ID: <434BAF30.5060709@xfce.org>

Hey all,

I made a simple test plugin for the new panel that can be used as a 
template for new plugins or as a reference for porting existing plugins.

It's a minimal plugin showing some of the essential features of the new 
plugin API as well as a 'proper' build system using the xfce4-dev-tools.

Suggestions for improvements are welcome.

Andre Lerche, the previous maintainer, handed this project over to me. I
just released a new version with a minor fix and would of course be glad
if you could port it.

Aha, good! I just did a port yesterday ;-) Available from 
http://www.xfce.org/~jasper/plugins/ . Maybe you could have a look and 
port your fix(es).

I'l let you import it into SVN, unless you prefer me to do that. The 
tarball does not contain an autogen.sh and still has all generated files 
available. I would suggest you take the autogen.sh from the test plugin 
(xfce4-test-plugint.tar.gz) and run './autogen.sh clean' to remove the 
generated files, before adding it to SVN.

just finished implementing the hddtemp feature for the new panel 4.3.22

very glad.

simply checkout xfce4-sensors-plugin/trunk from berlios svn.

comments and requests for enhancements are very welcome.

translations would also like to become updated for the new panel API and
the hddtemp feature.

Is it possible to make the font and icon scalable in this plug-in? It

Message-ID: <1129369092.22291.9.camel@TIM3000>

Hi!

The mount plugin now has the ability to specify the (u)mount command:

http://mitglied.lycos.de/timshome/download/options-dialog.png

Besides, the dialog has been cleaned and stuffed with lots of tooltips
preventing unexperienced users from using this advanced option.

Unfortunately, I'm not going to port it to the xfce4-panel 4.2.* branch,
so you will have to use the new panel API (which has been stabilized
very much) from Xfce svn repository.

If you think it might be better to simply have a toggle button "execute
with sudo", please answer this email!

The archives can be found at
https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=910 and
under svn at berlios.

Best regards, Fabian

It now is also available as package on berlios. If some BSD user could
point me where to find block device information under *BSD, I'd be very
glad and try to implement it.

Besides, I noticed that some screnshots are available at berlios. If
some admins want to add more, they can add

Subject: Xfmedia Remote Plugin
Message-ID: <20051015210023.GA7010@lucifer.localdomain>

Hi everyone,

I'm pleased to announce the new version of Xfmedia Remote Plugin for
the panel. It's been around for a while, but only known to some irc
peeps. Now that I finally got around implementing support for the new
Xfmedia D-BUS methods, it has enough functionality to be actually a bit
useful. It also supports the new (svn) panel api.

Download at berlios:
http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=4430

A few screenshots:
http://developer.berlios.de/screenshots/?group_id=4430

One note: There is a combination of Xfmedia and D-BUS versions, namely
Xfmedia < 0.10.0svn and D-BUS > 0.31, on which there is no playlist
menu like the one in the screenshot. This is due problems that have
been fixed, so if possible, use either the development version of
Xfmedia or the old D-BUS.

Have fun,
-Pasi

Hi developers,

I'm from Xfce-i18n, have been working as PO file committer,
now I have Polish and Spanish translation files for your plugins
(xfce4-netload-plugin 0.3.3, xfce4-showdesktop-plugin 0.4.0,
xfce4-systemload-plugin 0.3.6).

As far as I know, there isn't xfce-goodies-i18n list, therefore
translators will post their translation to xfce-i18n, but I'm not
sure how they should be treated in that list, so could you tell
me how I can commit them or could you commit them instead of me?

Regards,

I would suggest that we ask Daichi to commit the po files to Berlios 
SVN. This is by far the easiest for everyone involved, translators and 
developers.

Daichi, to get access to Berlios SVN you need to get an account 
(http://developer.berlios.de). If you send me your berlios user name, I 
can add you to the xfce-goodies project.

If anyone wants to handle the translations differently, please reply to 
this mail.

Thanks,
	Jasper

When I tried to register, my Firefox 1.0.4 claimed certification
from that site was invalid, so I'm pending my registration. Does
that site have certified problem actually or did my browser have

Message-ID: <200510201654.j9KGs2qq014590@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #5401, was updated on 2005-Oct-20 17:54
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: Goodies for the Xfce desktop
Category: xfce4-battery-plugin
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: None
Priority: 5
Submitted by: josem
Assigned to : none
Summary: xfce4-battery-plugin does not see ac_adapter status

Details: This is a bug showed a long time ago.
I am using debian testing and the battery plugin does not know then I am using only battery. I shows-me the "ac" allways.

I "corrected" the bug on my pc, but it's a bad solution. (It's no solution at all.)
Just added the line to get the right /proc/acpi file (libacpi.c):

   if (!(acpi = fopen ("/proc/acpi/ac_adapter/0/status", "r")))
    if (!(acpi = fopen ("/proc/acpi/ac_adapter/ACAD/state", "r")))
      if (!(acpi = fopen ("/proc/acpi/ac_adapter/AC/state", "r")))
+      if (!(acpi = fopen ("/proc/acpi/ac_adapter/AC0/state", "r")))
        if (!(acpi = fopen ("/proc/acpi/ac_adapter/ADP1/state", "r")))
                return -1;

Maybe you can think in a more elegant way to get this file (like you do with the battery state).

Thanks for the pacience.

Excellent. I've added you to the project and updated the permissions. I 
believe it may take up to 6 hours for the changes to take effect.

SVN can be accessed either through svn+ssh:// or https://, instructions 
are here: https://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=910 .

Welcome to Xfce Goodies! ;-) And, I can't say this enough, I'm very glad 
you are putting all this time and effort into keeping our translations 
up-to-date.

Let me know if there's anything I can do to help,

	Jasper

There's already a Spanish translation for the netload plugin. Just
update to latest SVN. From the header comment, I think it's the same.

Ah okay, then please make sure whether its charset is UTF-8,
since that file posted to the xfce-i18n was ISO-8859-1 while
'Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8' in the header (I've
converted it and attached here).

hi!

though mailwatch-plugin isn't maintained as goodie, it would like to have mailwatch.desktop.in.in in po/POTFILES.in ...

wouldn't it be simpler to have _any_ plugin besides the very basic ones such as launcher, clock, pager, taskbar maintained as a goodie on berlios?

Gmrun has some nice features (the way tab completion is implemented)
that should be incorporated intor the mini-command-line. The fact that
gmrun uses gtk and that it does not use any button (like mcl) should
help matters. It might also worth looking for ideas regarding xfrun4.

Sorry, I should have explained. The goodies are all separate toplevel 
modules. Almost all of them are 
svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/xfce-goodies/<name>/trunk, but one or two 
unfortunately only have code in the toplevel.

Try something like

svn ls https://daichi at svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/xfce-goodies

for a list of modules.

I hope that helps,

	Jasper

My preference is that both the minicmd plugin and the xfrun4 use the 
same input, tab completion and history methods. Maybe it's an idea to 
add the plugin to the xfce4-utils package (in which xfrun4 resides, I 
believe) and thus give xfrun4 2 interfaces?

A complete rewrite of the clipman plugin, now using GPtrArray, because
it's safer and easier to handle.
This release fixes a couple of bugs in the previous version and adds
some new features: Separated clipboards (in menu), colored menu items,
add same type when clipboard was empty.

Note: you can change the menu items colors in the clipboard rc file.

You can download the 0.6 version

Ok, it seems that we like dokuwiki now (see thunar.xfce.org/wiki and 
i18n.xfce.org), so I thought I'd try and make a template for Xfce 
Goodies and add some content to show you what I was thinking about.

So, here's my proposal for a new website for xfce goodies, which I also 
propose to host on the new Xfce server with xfce-goodies.xfce.org domain:

http://xfce.loculus.nl/xfce-goodies-wiki

Please tell me what you think.

It has acl's setup so you can't actually edit anything, except the 
Feedback section.

I also made a tarball of the entire wiki, if you are interested in the 
code: http://xfce.loculus.nl/files/xfce-goodies-wiki.tar.gz

well, i like it. quite xfce'ish, quite goodie'ish, clean, simple. I'd
say, let's only improve text and content so the site will be available
very soon and hopefully not be overloaded.

Do you have XDT installted? Because ./autogen.sh --prefix=<somewhere> works
fine here.

I think it is very good idea to move xfce-goodies website and svn to
Xfce server. I don't understand one thing: why you added 'Artwork'
section to xfce-goodies wiki? I think such stuff has already its
own place at www.xfce-look.org.

Best regards,
Piotr Wolny

i think the point is that at xfce-look, there are plenty of gnome
themes, metacity themes etc. and that it would really be nice to have a
place where themes for the xfce gtk engine, xfwm4 and xfce-dedicated gdm
themes were listed.

Ah, I see. Well, I can't find xfce4-dev-tools for 4.2.2. I can only find
them for 4.3.0. I have xfce4-4.2.2 installed. When I install the tools for
4.3.0 and then run autoconf.sh, it finishes but complains about
libxfce4panel not being the correct version. There are other errors also.

It looks like this is really just for xfce4 4.3.

   Hi all,

   After a long delay I finally got my internet service connected last 
week. I checked out the SVN tree by the method described below but I got 
compilation errors at some stage. I want to retyry. I want to port the 
XMMS plugin to the new interface and add the timer plugin to the tree. I 
know there were going to be some changes in the server. Is the one below 
still the correct place to get code from and submit to? Thanks,

   Ilgar

Yes it's written for the new Xfce4-panel, if you want to try it you'll have
to
compile libxfcegui4, xfce4-panel and libxfce4util from SVN.

	It looks nice. The similar looking to the XFCE web site is a
good solution.

	Somebody told that the artwork is related to the xfce-look.org
site. I agree, but I also think that an "oficial" artwork should be
defined an placed at the goodies web page. From that page, a link can
be included to the xfce-look.org site.

cheers,

Xavier
