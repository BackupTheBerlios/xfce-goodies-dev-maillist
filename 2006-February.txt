Subject: xkb-plugin: missing layout
Message-ID: <200602031102.44955.contact@kikinovak.net>

Hi,

I'm an Austrian writer living in Montpezat (South France), and a 100% 
GNU/Linux user since 2001. I've been using XFCE (on Slack and now Zenwalk 
Linux) for some time now, and I really like it: slim, fast, sexy, no bloat.

I also work as a translator, and as such, I mainly use three different 
keyboard layouts: german, swiss french and french. Respective country codes 
are de, fr_CH and fr. 

Unfortunately only de and fr are implemented in the xkb-plugin for XFCE. I 
have a request to Santa Claus (a.k.a B. Meurer:oD): would it be possible to 
include fr_CH (with a cute Swiss flag) and integrate it in the plugin? this 
would enable me to do my translation work with XFCE.

Cheers,

Niki Kovacs

Hey everyone,

There's something I've been laying on my hd for the past few months,
and now thought I might as well share it.

It's a panel plugin that listens dbus messages and displays them in the
panel and/or a popup window in the corner of the screen. It can be used
for example to display log event notifications (see scripts dir in
source tarball).

Regardless of it's name (which sucks btw, but I couldn't come up with a
better one), it has nothing to with the IM system originating from
Redmond, WA.

Screenie:
http://medusa.tutka.fi/~pasi/xfce4-messenger-screenshot.jpg

Tarball:
http://medusa.tutka.fi/~pasi/xfce4-messenger-plugin-0.1.0.tar.bz2

It requires the SVN panel and DBus >= 0.31. All feedback appreciated.

-Pasi

Hi

Just a suggestion: How about -dbus-plugin? The term messenger could,
indeed, be a bit confusing.

Regards
Stefan

Thanks for the suggestion, but I think -dbus-plugin wouldn't describe it
any better, as it's just using DBus for ipc communication, and has very
little to do with DBus itself. I'm still all open for suggestions.

Hi

Okay, this took quite some time, but I finally got around to importing
your port into the repo. I had to further mess with the gtk boxes but now
it should be ok.

Unless somebody complains about broken things I'm going to make a release
sometime soon (next week, probably).

Subject: ANNOUNCE: Verve 0.1.0 - A panel command line plugin
Message-ID: <43E7FE72.5030204@xfce.org>

Hi all,

if you've ever wanted to have command auto-completion in the
command line plugin, you'll probably like to hear that this is what
you can get now. I've written a new command line plugin implementation
for the panel (new framework, so SVN-only) which provides you with
exactly this:

  * auto-completion of commands in $PATH (TAB key)
  * command history browsing just like in minicmd (UP/DOWN arrows)
  * URL opening in your favourite browser (requires exo-open and is
    not yet optional; thus, you need a very recent checkout of
    libexo from SVN)
  * opening of your favourite eMail program with the compose window
    opened, once you execute an eMail address in Verve

And there's still more to come.

I've been added to the Xfce Goodies project on BerliOS and
uploaded the version 0.1.0 tarball there. You can get it from here:

http://download.berlios.de/xfce-goodies/verve-plugin-0.1.0.tar.bz2

Please file bug reports, feature requests and the like on BerliOS
or xfce-goodies-dev at lists.berlios.de. Thanks!

BTW, I still need translators for it, but I'm not sure where to
ask for them - xfce-i18n at xfce.org or xfce-goodies-dev at lists.berlios.de?

Hope you'll enjoy it.

Regards,
Jannis

Jannis,

I have not been able to test drive your plugin yet, so please shoot me 
if this is too preliminary... Is it possible to launch your command line 
plugin in a pop up window (aka run dialog) ?

It would be very cool to have a single interface to the command line 
with the same features (auto completion, etc) and history. And when the 
plugin is already loaded, it would probably pop up really fast too...

Just a thought,

Harold.

No, this is not possible with my plugin. But there will be a new version
of xfrun soon (because it takes too long to pop up) and I'll do my best
to keep the features and behaviour of both, my plugin and xfrun, in sync.

Can't build your plugin
configure script complains on absence of exo package. Where can I get it?

You'll need exo from the the Xfce SVN (http://svn.xfce.org/svn/xfce).
Verve also requires xfce4-panel from there. With Xfce 4.4 you will be
able to build this plugin regularly.

For sure, I like the idea. The problem is just that it doesn't seems to work, at least for me :-/. 
And this plugin is taking lots of place inside my panel. Having an option to hide him when nothing is displayed would be a great things I think.

Anyway, if you want I can host your plugin on Berlios, where most of them are. Just get an account and I'll add you to the project.
Also if you need some help, just ask ;).

After removing the

line in configure.in and run xdt-autogen in the root directory of the plugin, all worked ok.

Trust me, this check is for the 4.2.x panel (xfce4-panel-1.0.pc).

Doesn't work? Could you please elaborate on this? Doesn't compile? Error
messages? Anything?

Currently, both the icon and the label in the panel can be hidden in the
preferences, when only the popup is shown on received message.

If the label would only be visible when a message is received, it would
cause other panel items to move to make space for the label. I'd guess
it'd get very annoying...

Well, I do have a Berlios account "pasi". I guess, if it's not too much
trouble, you could add me to the project, and I'll import the sources
at later stage, after I've renamed the project.

Perhaps I could exploit the possibility further, and add Xfmedia Remote
plugin there as well... though I've no idea where Xfmedia is currently
going.

Compile and install OK. In fact, the things is just that it doesn't display any message.

so hiding both icon and label is perhaps the right config for me.

Possible, but I would like to test it once (no a big prob tough).

Ok, i've added you. we just have to get a name now.... what about something like xfce4-notification-plugin? (perhaps not funny enough)

sure. Also for xfmedia, I know it was in a great rewritte state a month ago. This is probably still the case.

That's odd. Are you sure your session bus is functioning properly? The
plugin prints error messages about DBus connectivity problems, so
~/.xsession-errors might contain some info. You could also try running
`dbus-monitor` and see how it reacts when you send a message to the
plugin.

That's my preferred config as well.

This is pretty easy to implement, so I try to remember to add it.

That's definitely the most descriptive candidate, and that's what it's
going to be. I'll import the sources in a few days, thanks!

Yeah, Brian's quite busy with other stuff, so the refactoring is
proceeding quite slowly, but the plugin should work fine with the
current svn version. It's only a matter of keeping the plugin updated.

And fixed in the rev. 1028, thank you.
If that isn't still displayed properly, let me know.

Here I am, Verve causes segfault against the xfce4-panel 4.3.28,
it was compiled with gcc 4.0.1, gtk+ 2.9.0, glib 2.6.0. It was
happened when I tried to add this plugin to the panel. You can
stack trace at the attached file (xfce4-panel.bt).

Take a look at the attached patch (configure.in.in.patch), without
this modifying, PACKAGE related strings defined in the config.h must
be messed with my Autotools (autoconf 2.59, automake 1.9.3).

If you have kind enough also apply the patch for PO files
(verve-po.patch), your de.po breaks build process without special
checker flag.

No, it was a bus error actually on IRIX 6.5 (big endian)
by verve-plugin 0.1.0 (rev. 1030).

So it's not due to a problem in the verve-plugin?

Yeah, applied both of your patches and commited them to SVN. Could you
try building it again?

Oh yeah, PACKAGE_LOCALE_DIR isn't defined. How about this
patch? seems there's an extra slash as well.

Hmm, but still bus error there.

Why is this an internal plugin? Plugins should be external unless there 
is a very good reason for it not to be. I specifically created this 
possibility so that plugins would not crash the panel :(

I remember having trouble with gaining the keyboard focus of the
command line input field when compiling it as an external plugin.
Anyway, I can understand this concept and tried to apply your patch.
It's properly installed and such, but once you want to add it to the
panel, there is a CRITICAL message in the panel log and the plugin is
removed again. Can you please look into that or tell me how to get more
descriptive logs?

Regards,
Jannis

Hmm, it works fine for me. What is the message exactly?

Well, it basically means your plugin crashes. Maybe I have different 
libraries/dependencies installed, so my plugin may not trigger the crash.

I have to think about how to debug an external plugin properly. Hmm, it 
would be kinda cool to have 'xfce4-<name>-plugin --debug' which would 
run the plugin in a separate window...

Here a make.log is attached as well. Jannis, do you think the
warning below can be harmful?

Daichi, Jannis, please try the attached patch. I replaced

Ah, that makes sense. Didn't know about that, because I'm new to GTK+.
I applied the patch and it seems to work. I'm going to commit it in a
second.

Thanks,

No, this shouldn't cause any problems. The shells listed in the
supported_shells array are just *possible* shells, which Verve searches
for in $PATH. It only makes use of those who can be found. So
if /usr/freeware/bin is in your $PATH, "bash" should be found.

Anyway, this part of verve-env.c is almost unused at the moment. It's
intended to be used in a future feature.

Jannis

It works here, at least a plugin doesn't crash anymore, the
problems still remain are, as Jannis said, verve isn't focused
(while right click shows a menu properly) and a property dialog
keeps showing English as-is (confirmed GETTEXT_PACKAGE is
"verve-plugin", a message object located in the
"/usr/local/share/locale/ja/LC_MESSAGES/verve-plugin.mo").

I'm still having this problem, too. Any ideas what might cause this? Do
I have to call g_set_application_name or something like that when
running it as an external plugin?

Many thx for your work. From my side, I also made some little changes to remove a bug and some compilation warnings. I hope it won't break translations (I will have a look this evening)

Subject: [Bug 1462]  New: The battery plugin isn't accurate with battery status
Message-ID: <20060214204319.B39BFF2926@mocha.foo-projects.org>

Do NOT reply to this email.  To make further comments on this bug, use
the URL below:
http://bugzilla.xfce.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1462

           Summary: The battery plugin isn't accurate with battery status
           Product: Xfce Panel Plugins
           Version: unspecified
          Platform: PC
        OS/Version: Linux
            Status: NEW
          Severity: minor
          Priority: Medium
         Component: battery
        AssignedTo: xfce-goodies-dev at berlios.de
        ReportedBy: debianized at gmail.com


Every time I use the AC power, the battery plugin displays numbers over 100% of
charge.

After disconnect the AC adaptator, the percentage doesn't change for 2 minutes
and then displays numbers under 100% (normal).

For example, at this moment I have 224% of energy!

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable the battery plugin.
2. Connect the AC power.
3. The battery charge starts and the plugin displays status over 100%.

Actual Results:  
The battery plugin displays incorrect battery information.

Expected Results:  
Display the correct battery status.

- Ubuntu Breezy Badger (5.10)
- kernel 2.6.12-10-386
- acpi 0.09

True. But after adding it to verve-plugin.c, nothing changed. I still
don't get the correct translation.

Hmm, by including that missing header, it gets worked here (verve.jpg),
thanks Jasper. For what it's worth, I attach a patch just being added
a function xfce_panel_plugin_menu_show_configure() in it (ignore the
others, nothing but a style change).

Ah, yes, sorry. It also works here now. I included the config.h below
all other includes, which of course doesn't make any sense.

BTW, there also is a xfce_panel_plugin_menu_show_configure() call a few
lines above the line you placed yours! Hehe.

Hi

Small correction: I recently ported the fsguard plugin (see svn). It's
just not released yet (there's some issue with executing a command I have
to look into).

A ported version is part of the panel now.

works fine apart from the fact that the battery icon is not scalable 
with the panel...

I had an issue with being unable to copy/paste graphic content with this

works fine for me, though it may prevent the panel to be resized down. 
At least I cannot make the panel where I have this plugin smaller than 
certain size...

the version from Jasper's page currently crashes with a recent build of 
the panel on Ubuntu Dapper... though it may be something to do with 
Dapper than the plugin itself. My xfce4-svn build on the stable Ubuntu 
Breezy is quite outdated.

           Summary: xfce4-battery-plugin-0.3.0 does not see ac_adapter
                    status
           Product: Xfce Panel Plugins
           Version: unspecified
          Platform: PC
        OS/Version: Linux
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
          Priority: Medium
         Component: battery
        AssignedTo: xfce-goodies-dev at berlios.de
        ReportedBy: ulm at kph.uni-mainz.de


On a HP Compaq nc6120 laptop, the battery plugin does not see the ac_adapter
status. It will always report AC connected. Similar issue for thermal_zone.

Attached patch fixes the problem for me (and I hope it is a general solution).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start battery panel plugin
2. Plug / unplug AC adapter
Actual Results:  
"AC" is always shown.

Expected Results:  
"AC" should only be shown if on AC power.

Subject: New panel plugin: xfce4-radio-plugin && need assistance
Message-ID: <20060223043037.GC4374@cheddar.desire.ch>

Hi everybody

I just (more or less) finished work on a v4l radio plugin for the xfce panel
(xfce4-radio-plugin on SVN) and would like to ask those of you who own a v4l
radio device to beta test it. It's currently for the 4.2 panel only - I'll
port it as soon as I get around to installing the new panel on the machine
with the radio tuner.

Anyway, there is a small issue I couldn't resolve: The plugin remembers some
settings (station presets, mostly) which are not configured within the
preferences dialog, thus xfce doesn't call the write_config function after
they are modified. I am now wondering whether there is some way the plugin
can tell xfce to please call write_config immediately.

Regards

You could try calling panel_write_config(), but I'm not sure the plugins 
have access to that.

For 4.4 the plugin is responsible for saving its own preferences, so 
this won't be a problem.

Okay, thanks for your reply. I just added a note to the README.

For now, pages are just plain html (I have no time to make something better...)
Since you add a plugin, 2 things can be done:
-Post a News
-Update the page who describe all the plugins

To have an access to these pages, you can use ssh to log in using your belios 's account. The server is shell.berlios.de
You can also use scp to copy these page to you pc, change them and then upload them in berlios.
The commands are:
To copy from Berloios to your pc:
scp username at shell.berlios.de:/home/groups/xfce-goodies/htdocs/ /home/Your_directory/name_of_the_file
To copy from your pc to Berloios:
scp /home/Your_directory/name_of_the_file username at shell.berlios.de:/home/groups/xfce-goodies/htdocs/

The files are:
contact.html    goodies.html  menu.html   
download.html   news.html     packages.html
index.html      top.html        

In your case, you just have to edit the news.html and packages.html pages.

Generally, it's me who maintain these pages, so if you want I can add your plugin myself. But if you to post the news and add the descrption yourself, you are free to do that.

Also, if you have any question... just ask ;-)

        AssignedTo: xfce-goodies-dev at berlios.de
        ReportedBy: xfce-bug at sstuhr.dk


Instances of the showdesktop plugin in latest SVN panel makes the panel higher
(horizontal panels - haven't tested in vertical panels [1]) than configured in
the panel settings dialog.

[1]: I have just tried to make a new vertical panel, and the panel crashed when
I tried to make it vertical - will fill separate bug, if it isn't the same as
the last one I filled.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add a new panel.
2. Add an instance of the showdesktop plugin to the new panel.
Actual Results:  
The panel size gets bigger than configured in the panel settings dialog.

Expected Results:  
The showdesktop plugin should respect the size configured by users.

I don't think the workspace control items in the windowlist menu should be shown
when the "Include all Workspaces" option is off. Eventually - if people really
want it when they have "Include all Workspaces" off - it should be an option.

(The windowlist plugin included with Xfce4 SVN)

Fixes indentation (mixed tabs and spaces > spaces) in plugin_button_clicked

------- Additional Comments From mike.massonnet at gmail.com  2006-02-27 20:55 UTC -------
I used the battery plugin on XFCE4.3 this week-end and I didn't noticed any 
problems. What charge do you have with `acpi -V` or by reading the 
file(s) /proc/acpi/battery/*/stat{e,us} ? I think the problem is not in the 
plugin but an acpi problem. 

Kind regards,
Mike Massonnet.

I use a notebook with an optional PCMCIA wireless card. When the card is not
plugged in, device wlan0 doesn't exist, but the plugin still sits in the panel.
Because the panel graphics are too big (compare with other mem/cpu/net panel
plugins), it takes up too much space.

It should either auto-hide even when the device is not present (ie. card is not
plugged in, therefore signal can't be measured anyway) or the lugin should be
redesigned to save space like other plugins (eg.
http://xfce-goodies.berlios.de/images/xfce4-battery.png )
