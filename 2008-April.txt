Subject: xfce weather plugin international problem
Message-ID: <664d43d60804092332i35799bddv2cc8ddb0b2fafde7@mail.gmail.com>

Dear XFCE4 devs,

Found minor bug with day of week full name.
In panel-plugin/weather-translate.c the DAY_LOC_N is set to 20
bytes. It's insufficient for Russian at least:
Sunday and Monday both need 22 as they are 11 unicode letters long. Could be
also the problem for other languages.

Would be great to have this fixed.
Thank you in advance.
