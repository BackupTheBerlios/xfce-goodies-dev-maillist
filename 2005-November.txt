           Summary: weather plugin build error on solaris 10 x86
           Product: Xfce Panel Plugins
           Version: unspecified
          Platform: Other
        OS/Version: other
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
          Priority: Medium
         Component: weather
        AssignedTo: xfce-goodies-dev at berlios.de
        ReportedBy: nobody at bg.pearl.dtdns.net


xfce4 version 4.2.2.  When building on solaris 10 x86 from pkgsrc I 
receive compiler errors in function create_summary_tab and the build exits. 
  
  

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. cd pkgsrc/misc/xfce4-weather-plugin  
2. bmake  install 
3. after fixing the mixer plugin build as described in another forum,  
everything will build for xfce, except the weather plugin  
  
Actual Results:  
summary_window.c: In function `create_summary_tab': 
summary_window.c:25: error: syntax error before numeric constant 
summary_window.c:112: error: invalid lvalue in assignment 
summary_window.c:114: warning: pointer/integer type mismatch in conditional 
expression 
summary_window.c:116: warning: passing arg 1 of `g_free' makes pointer from 
integer without a cast 
summary_window.c:120: error: invalid lvalue in assignment 
summary_window.c:122: warning: pointer/integer type mismatch in conditional 
expression 
summary_window.c:124: warning: passing arg 1 of `g_free' makes pointer from 
integer without a cast 
summary_window.c:130: error: `vis' undeclared (first use in this function) 
summary_window.c:130: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once 
summary_window.c:130: error: for each function it appears in.) 
gmake: *** [libweather_la-summary_window.lo] Error 1 
 

Expected Results:  
The plugin should have been built and installed  

Here is the link to the xfce forum post, where others are having similar   
issues with building on solaris/solaris (sparc).  There is a listed  
fix that works for the mixer plugin and allows compilation to continue until  
you get to the weather plugin, for which, I've found no fix.  
  
http://www.os-cillation.de/cgi-bin/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=Help;action=display;num=1109782807  
 
You can see that I receive the same error in the weather plugin as another user 
two xfce versions ago and several lines have been added to summary_window.c 
since then.

It seems that a header is included which defines the a symbolic constant named
"sun". As the code tries to declare a variable named "sun" it obviously doesn't
work.
The attached patch should fix this by changing the name of the variable used.
Apply with path -p0 < sun_patch.diff

Message-ID: <200511062314.jA6NEcT7029776@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #5565, was updated on 2005-Nov-06 21:14
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: Goodies for the Xfce desktop
Category: None
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: None
Priority: 5
Submitted by: rainer_alves
Assigned to : none
Summary: GTK 2.8 breaks the taskbar plugin

Details: I've upgraded GTK to version 2.8 on my FreeBSD box, and it seriously breaks the taskbar plugin, here is the screenshot: http://www.powered.net/rainer/xfce_taskbarplugin_gtk28.jpg
It looks like the plugin no longer grabs each button's width correctly, and thus doesn't wrap the label properly, putting all labels on top of each other.

Note that I've recompiled all xfce pieces after the GTK upgrade, and everything else works perfectly fine.

PS: Everything was upgraded using the ports system.

XFCE4 4.2.2 with version 0.2.2 of the taskbar plugin

Long window names - such as a browser window or a deep folder name - will "spill
out" to the and cover the buttons of the other windows. 

For example, the window for this site is titled "Enter A Bug - Mozilla Firefox".
The "Mozilla Firefox" is too big to fit within the box and so spills over and
covers the window to the right. 

I've compiled both the panel and taskbar plugin several times, using two
versions of the plugin. 

This is a cosmetic, but annoying bug, as while it doesn't interfere in any way
with being able to click on another window

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
No special steps are needed, this is a constant annoyance



Gentoo Linux distro, using kernel 2.6.12-gentoo-r8

GTK version 2.6.8

XFCE 4.2.2 and xfce-taskbar plugin 0.2.2

As I said in the bug report I've created earlier today, (#5565, "GTK 2.8 breaks
the taskbar plugin"), I'm having the exact same problem.. my screenshot showing
the problem is here: http://www.powered.net/rainer/xfce_taskbarplugin_gtk28.jpg

I initially thought this problem was limited to gtk 2.8 (since the taskbar
plugin worked fine here while I used gtk 2.6).

           Summary: taskbar does not shorten label/title
           Product: Xfce Panel Plugins
           Version: unspecified
          Platform: Other
        OS/Version: FreeBSD
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal

         Component: taskbar
        AssignedTo: xfce-goodies-dev at berlios.de
        ReportedBy: sgaerner at gmx.net


The label/title of the program that is shown in the taskbar plugin is not
shortened. If the label/title is longer than the width of the button, the
label/title is drawn over the next button in the taskbar.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Taskbar settings: expand to fill screen, show label
2. Open a program with a long title, e.g. sylpheed.
3. Show the taskbar plugin. The title is not cut to the button width.



Expected Results:  
The label/title shown in the taskbar plugin should be limited to the width of
the button otherwise all buttons are more or less unreadable.

I am also using gentoo .. and having this bug.

xfce4-session version says this:

Built with Gtk+-2.6.8, running with Gtk+-2.83.

Maybe it could be this mismatch that causes the bug.

Message-ID: <4374D8D5.8080706@on-the-hill.me.uk>

I wonder if anyone knows when the plugins are going to be ported to a 
new panel? I know that there are some of the are unofficially ported by 
Jasper, but it's only a few... Being on svn version of xfce I miss some 
of them (xkb, datetime, wavelan, showdesktop).

I've just released 0.0.2 of the Dell i8k plugin...
no major functional changes but several clean ups and just better design.

-Timeout between updates configurable.
-If i8k module not installed or error with /proc/i8k it will display 
"Disabled"
-No longer uses i8k userland utils but the ioctl's.

I'll be releasing a 4.4 version soon with some more enhancements.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0511170423470.15947@zeno3.math.washington.edu>


   Hi everyone,

   After a long busy period I found some time to install the SVN version of 
XFCE. Attached is my new timer plugin for XFCE 4.4 panels. I've sent a 
version for 4.2 panels about 2 months ago but it had size adjustment 
problems. This one works OK thanks to the new API. A quick reminder: This 
works similar to the KTeaTime applet for KDE. You specify a countdown 
period or set an alarm time. When the time comes, you get a warning window 
and/or a command you specify is run. Currently I'm using a progressbar to 
indicate the time elapsed. Maybe I'll later replace it with a nice 
sequence of images. Also we may have a default sound file to play as the 
alarm. Feedbacks are welcome.

   I'll upload this to SVN soon. I'm also the maintainer of the XMMS 
plugin, and I'll port that one also to the new API.

   Ilgar

   Grr, it's been hours and my two messages didn't make it to the list. 
This time I won't attach the correct file, but just give a link:

   Hi,

   Here's the link to the ported plugin package. I have Gtk 2.8 so I had to 
throw in some Cairo cflags and ldflags. I don't know much about autoconf 
scripts so I'd appreciate if someone could verify that it works well with 
Gtk 2.6 (Note that this plugin requires Pango >= 1.8.0). The official 
release that I'll upload to SVN will include some tiny modifications to 
this one, and possibly changes suggested in the feedbacks.

Subject: xkb-plugin names & flags
Message-ID: <4385d4f8.1e7cd2db.6a0a.ffff86c2@mx.gmail.com>

Hi.

I have two layouts in my xorg.conf file: us and es. I can switch between
them either with a key combination or by clicking the button that I added to
my panel. (xfce4-xkb-plugin) 

This is what is displayed on the button label when I switch between these
two layouts:

Layout	Text		Flag
us		"PC"		none, "PC" is also shown
es		"US"		United States

You can imagine how annoying and confusing this is. So, where does the
plugin take the names and flags from, so that I can change that to something
coherent. I care the most about the text, flags don't really matter.

Thanks in advance, and sorry if I posted a FAQ, I couldn't find it in the
lists.

Hi,

The genmon plugin is, IMHO, an extremely good idea as
it allows for creating new plugins in a fast way, using
output of some simple scripts (instead of writing GTK
stuff each time). However, the following features could
be added:

1. A bar (or a few of them) below the text showing
graphically the current value (like for system load)
provided by the input script.

2. A configurable text in the tooltips, also provided
by the input script.

For example, a script could output the following format
of data each time executed:

Data
30 50
This is a dynamic tooltip (30/50)

and the plugin would then show the text "Data", two
bars: the former filled in 30% and the latter in 50%
with the defined tooltip.

Message-ID: <43799DA8.2090108@static-void-main.de>

hi,

if you start the plugin with no battery attached the percentage of
remaining battery capacity is not shown if you later plug in the battery.
This is because the plug in could not load the last full capacity
(because no battery was present).

A possible solution is to add

stat = *(ptr + 25);
if (stat == 'y')
{
+ if (acpiinfo->present == 0)
+ {
+	read_acpi_info(battery);
+ }
if ((ptr = strstr (buf, "charging state:")) || (ptr = strstr (buf,
"State:")))
{

to line 529 to get the necessary data.

greetings
Matthias Eller
