Subject: Updates i18n stuffs
Message-ID: <20060105005305.32e0ac53.daichi@xfce.org>

Hi,

As you've already known, i18n stuffs in the xfce-goodies are
modified by me. Some keeps 4.2.x structure, some gets changed
for the new panel system, while they're located in the trunk
tree.

If possible, please create 4.2 branch for the old ones, trunk
might be supposed to used with the latest panel. Also, if my
modifying prevents your layout plan actually, feel free to
revert them.

One thing I've been wondering is why there're so many auto-
generated files are imported? perhaps it required on some
platforms (like FreeBSD or Solaris, hmm not sure) though.

Regards,

Subject: How to get to Xfce 4.4
Message-ID: <43C0F643.6000003@xfce.org>

Hi all,

So, here we are, it's 2006 and we need to start getting serious about 
releasing Xfce 4.4 if we want to do the release in February.

Warning: this is a very long email!

Let me try to list a few things that need to be done or that I would 
like to see. A few different areas can be distinguished: code, 
translations, documentation, website and xfce subprojects.


Code
====

Libraries

* They work, but it would not be a bad idea if someone were to go over 
them and see if we can clean things up a bit, now that we can depend on 
gtk 2.6.

* One thing that might be a good candidate to put in the libraries is 
the menu spec handling. Currently xfdesktop uses different code from 
xfce4-appfinder. Probably after 4.4, unless someone volunteers to do the 
work.

* Similarly, the icon theme handling should be changed to use 
GtkIconTheme instead of our own implementation. This is not trivial and 
is probably something for after 4.4.

Desktop

For me this includes xfce4-session, xfce-mcs-manager/plugin, xfce-utils, 
xfwm4, xfdesktop, xfce4-panel, xfprint, xfce4-mixer, xfce4-appfinder and 
I think xfce4-mailwatch-plugin (Brian, what is your opinion?).

* It would be great if the session manager could have a special dialog 
for starting/stopping Xfce components, at least xfwm4, xfdesktop and 
xfce4-panel. Again, this require someone to do the work. I'm not sure 
how hard it would be.

* The display mcs plugin needs a 'Default' option that does nothing to 
solve problems with remote displays and FreeNX. This should be fairly 
easy and I might do this myself.

* Some people have complained about the speed of xfrun and suggested the 
use of gmrun (I think). We should check if we can't simply use gmrun 
code. Needs someone to do the work; should be fairly easy.

* Xfwm4 is just awesome, no need for changes ;-) Anyway, Olivier is a 
better judge of what needs to be done still.

* Brian said xfdesktop was slow to startup because of the menu 
generation. Maybe that can still be improved before 4.4? Other than 
that, it seems to work fine.

* The panel is now feature-complete, I believe. What it needs now is 
testing in as many situations as possible, especially multi-screen 
setups. There are a number of problems in that area i am aware of and 
will try to fix as soon as possible.

* Another thing to look at is which plugins should be included with the 
panel. Someone suggested to add the show-desktop plugin and I think 
maybe the windowlist plugin. Then we will have all window management 
plugins as part of the panel.

* The panel will need a new default configuration before 4.4, which 
could require some translations as well. This is one of the last things 
to decide though.

* The trigger launcher and xfce4-eyes-plugin should be moved to the 
goodies project, IMO.

* I don't now if xfprint and xfce4-appfinder need any work. Danny is 
busy porting xfce4-mixer to the new panel framework. The mailwatch 
plugin seems to work very well.

Applications

* There are a number of application that should release along with the 
desktop. Definitely that includes Orage, xffm and hopefully thunar.

* Other possibilities are xfmedia, mousepad and xfburn, but they don't 
necessarily have to be released at the same time as the desktop.

All

* I think what we need most is people checking out SVN and report 
problems. It needs to work in as many situations as possible.


Translations
============

It is always difficult to say when is the best time to start translating 
new code. We are at the start of a testing period (I hope ;-) and this 
may show problem in the interface that require string changes.

On the other hand, the modules should be more or less feature complete 
now and there are a lot of strings to translate, so it might be a good 
idea to start translating now.

At least developers should probably start notifying xfce-i18n of string 
changes.


Documentation
=============

Oh dear. Traditionally I have been very involved with the documentation, 
together with Francois. However, Francois is extremely busy with real 
life and I just started a new job, so I don't know how much time I will 
have.

The panel needs completely new documentation and also the window manager 
has changed quite a bit because shortcut handling is now in a separate 
mcs plugin.

If no-one volunteers to help, I will do the panel documentation myself, 
but I don't think I will have the time and energy to do other 
documentation.

Ideas about how to make it easier for people to help out with 
documentation (using a wiki, maybe?) are very welcome.


Website
=======

Xfce has grown from being a desktop project with a single website to 
being a platform with many sister projects: goodies, i18n, installers, 
thunar, xfmedia, mousepad, xffm, ... It would be very nice to have some 
consistency between all the related web sites.

The Xfce website could perhaps do with a little freshening up to better 
help our users find what they need.

I have been playing a little with php and css to see if it would be 
possible to recreate the Xfce site layout with only css and in a 
slightly more maintainable way. Check the result at 
http://www.loculus.nl/xfce/new.xfce.org/ . It is missing most of the 
content, only 'Home' and 'About' have some ;-) I have tried to reduce to 
number of toplevel links to make things a little easier to find.

As an example of what I believe is a well layed-out website take a look 
a www.freebsd.org, especially other pages than the front page: a small 
number of toplevel sections with a side bar  menu for subsections.

It would be nice to have a small team to take care of the maintainance 
of the site, hopefully together with Francois. Someone probably needs to 
have a look at what kind of information we have to show and how this can 
best be presented.


Other Xfce Projects
===================

I'd like to see Xfce develop further towards a small desktop project 
with a number of independent subprojects that provide additional 
functionality. It should be easy to find links to these projects on 
xfce.org.

www.xfce.org
- i18n.xfce.org
- goodies.xfce.org
- xffm.xfce.org
- thunar.xfce.org
- orage.xfce.org    | maybe some smaller applications could better
- mousepad.xfce.org | be part of goodies.xfce.org or even
- xfburn.xfce.org   | applications.xfce.org
- xfmedia.xfce.org
- forum.xfce.org
- wiki.xfce.org
- xfce-look.org
- bugzilla.xfce.org


Ok, now, all of this won't happen without people actually taking time to 
work on it. And this has always been our problem :(


Me
==

Now for me personally things have changed a bit because of the new job. 
I will not have as much time for Xfce and I will need to limit myself to 
the panel and maybe some related library work.

I need someone to manage and coordinate the plugins on the xfce goodies 
project as well as handle the possible move to the xfce server and 
update of the website. I'd like to propose Nicolas Masse for this job, 
if he agrees, and maybe some other active goodies developers to help 
out, like Fabian Nowak and Nick Schermer (or anyone who volunteers).


Maybe it would be nice if all developers would reply to this mail with a 
indication of what they plan to do before 4.4.


Phew! I need a coffee now. Or two.

cheers,
	Jasper

PS
When you reply it might be a good idea to only quote the parts that are 
relevant ;-)

PPS
Sorry for the spam, I hope it will be good for something.

well here I found an error just lately and I'm trying to fix it, but 
can't seem to do it the right way.
I've got the panel set up in vertical and the mixer doesn't display 
right, it's just a thin horizontal line with a button on the side, 
though I can control the sound level by middle-scroll.

As for the Panel Actions, I think it would be good to enable an command 
input box in it, so to allow the user to set an action on screen-lock, 
logout, reboot and halt.
i.e. I don't use sudo, and built my own type of a "user shutdown system"
so I'd like to set the action performed by the reboot/halt command 
within the settings, though maybe it's just me, and people like me 
should stick to the code ;]

About the clock, I think it would be good to be able to set the font, 
the clock is displayed with. Cause the LED option is too big, and the 
number's option is too small (I use 1280x1024 screen size).

Again about the panel, I was thinking of another option to display 
multicommand activators. Right now there's an arrow informing of the 
possibility to show a small menu of other available commands.
I was thinking of an option to hide the arrow (making the whole icon 
smaller, and thus giving more space in the panel for others), and enable 
the same function by middle clicking on the icon (AFAIK it doesn't do 
anything right now) and maybe just putting a small mark on the icon 
telling that there is a menu.

so I guess somebody is already taking care of the Polish translation,
but if any help would be needed on this, I'll be glad to help.

Do You need any mirrors? I'm currently running my own server with some 
of the standard services (wftpd,apache,exim,php) and a 1MBit limitless 
connection, so I could do for a mirror, if not the whole page, maybe at 
least the ftp sections, though I'd preffer http dir's instead of anon ftp.

Other than those, I'm completely satisfied with xfce svn as of friday :)
I try to keep up doing svn builds once a week or two.

I leave that one for Danny to fix.

Hmm. Logout is performed by the session manager. I don't really want to 
add special purpose code to the panel. I don't remember if the session 
manager allows custom shutdown commands.

For the screensaver the panel uses the xflock4 script. It might be 
easier to modify that instead.

The clock could be improved a lot, but I don't think I will have the 
time to work on it. I would take a patch for this one, if someone else 
were to write it.

Other possible improvements: support for different time zones, support 
for showing the date and support for user-defined formats (like the 
date-time plugin). The dialog must remain simple though, so that will be 
a bit of a challenge ;-)

Not before 4.4 I think. Middle click is not a very convenient way to 
access the menu though. I already does pop up the menu if you hold the 
left mouse button, so maybe that would be enough?

Other ideas for the launcher include putting the last-used item on the 
panel (there's even a patch for that), but I think I will leave that 
until after 4.4 to decide.

You could always join the xfce-i18n mailing list are ask the current 
Polish translator directly if he needs any help.

Mirrors for source tarballs and binary packages are always welcome. You 
probably want to wait for at least the beta releases with that though. 
There's no need to mirror the web site itself, I think.

I agree. Also, can you send a mail to the list when you' ve done, so I will post a news on the xfce-goodies site. (yes, I think that posting a news for each little addition is important to show how much Xfce is a living project).

Note: I moved the discussion to the xfce-goodies-dev list since I think this is more relevant. 
Just one thing before I go: 
THX for the idea and for adding these wallpapers in the artwork package.

 ok, here I am (J.H.) I've changed Makefile.am & when I'll know Makefile
recreation method, Paltanen nature background will be added to
xfce4-artwork.

 Done :-) 1st Nature Background [  paltanen.jpg  ] is now part of

  xfce4-artwork in the trunk.

 Dear list, please help! Where can I find Xfce Mouse in SVG format?

I've always liked the way Palm did it. Simple, yet effective.

I attach 2 small screenies.

 THX, I think we MUST release graphical backgrounds in SVG format.

 1: xfdesktop supports SVG backrounds
 2: they are scalable anyway leisurely
 3: they have extra small filesize, so we can ship more hundreds of them
    if we want.

 I'm workin' on a nice SVG background, base-conception in the attachment :-)

Sorry, but it seems that I send my mail too fast :]

So, I would really like to :

1) Know if the above info are correct
2) Some plugins were ported unofficially by Jasper. I would like to know if they can be uploaded in berlios, or if someone made his own port. If no answer is given, I will then upload what Jasper did
3) Some said they ported some plugins in previous post, but there was nothing in the trunk branch of svn. I would like them to upload their version if possible.
4) Even if this is not urgent, it would be nice to have all the plugins ported for the 4.4 release of Xfce. I think we can begin to look at who will port the remaining plugins.

It's hard to tell when I will get to it. So if somebody likes to port it
feel free to do so!

Hello:

  The xfce4-plugin-screenshooter (vo 0.0.8) plugin has been released.

http://download.berlios.de/xfce-goodies/xfce4-screenshooter-plugin-0.0.8.tar.gz
in svn repos:
svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/xfce-goodies/xfce4-screenshooter-plugin

It takes screenshots, it's similar to gnome-screenshot, but this release
doesn't show a preview of the screenshot.
All feedback is welcomed.

cheers...

Message-ID: <BAY109-F61AFC8F357F4DBE71A9B39F180@phx.gbl>

Hi

I'm very new at this, but I'v been using gnu/linux now and I know basic 
programming. I love Xfce4 but I found it frustrating that you couldn't 
launch a browser or ftp-client by entering that kind of address in the 
mini-command-line so I wrote a tiny hack :P  It's not very pretty code and 
I/you should make it configurable so that the user can select which browser 
to use for ftp sftp and http - maybe something for the settings manager?

Anyhow since I want to help but don't know where to send my code I post it 
here (it's not very long). Please send suggestions and tell where I should 
send my code

///// in command.c    I add these two functions

gboolean cmd_is_httpaddress(const char * cmd)
{
  return(!strncmp(cmd, "http://", 7) || !strncmp(cmd, "www.", 4));
}

gboolean cmd_is_ftpaddress(const char * cmd)
{
  return(!strncmp(cmd, "ftp://", 6) || !strncmp(cmd, "sftp://", 7) );
}

/// end code


Then I modify do_run  into this

static gboolean do_run(const char *cmd, gboolean in_terminal)
{
    gchar *execute, *path;
    gboolean success;

    g_return_val_if_fail(cmd != NULL, FALSE);


    /* check if the user has entered a http or www command */
    if (cmd_is_httpaddress(cmd))
    {
      execute = g_strconcat("firefox ", cmd, NULL);
      success = exec_command(execute);
      g_free(execute);

      return success;
    }

    /* check if the user has entered a sftp or ftp command */
    if (cmd_is_ftpaddress(cmd))
    {
      execute = g_strconcat("nautilus ", cmd, NULL);
      success = exec_command(execute);
      g_free(execute);

      return success;
    }

// and the function continues

What do you think? My solution is not very pretty but it sure works (not 
very safe though), and it can be modifies into becoming a lot more 
configurable, but I just needed this code for myself so I wrote it :P  Maybe 
you like it too?

No, no yet. It's compatible with version 4.2.

Subject: A corrupted PNG image in xfce4-artwork
Message-ID: <20060121063301.b248efba.daichi@xfce.org>

Hi,

Could someone tell me how to fix this?

  In xfce4-artwork/trunk/backdrops:

  $ file *.png
  xfce-gradiented.png:  PNG image data, 1600 x 1200, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced
  xfce-rio.png:         PNG image data, CORRUPTED,
  xfce-transparent.png: PNG image data, 1600 x 1200, 8-bit/color RGBA, interlaced

  In xfce4-artwork/trunk/backdrops/.svn/prop-base:

  $ cat xfce-gradiented.png.svn-base
  K 13
  svn:mime-type
  V 24
  application/octet-stream
  END

  $ cat xfce-rio.png.svn-base
  K 13
  svn:eol-style
  V 6
  native
  K 12
  svn:keywords
  V 23
  author date id revision
  END

  $ cat xfce-transparent.png.svn-base
  K 13
  svn:mime-type
  V 24
  application/octet-stream
  END

Clearly, xfce-rip.png has been imported as a text.

differences from 4.2 plugin on which it is based

-uses rcfile instead of xml for config
-uses libxfcegui for adding/removing workspaces instead of X events
-uses an invisible dummy widget instead of an event box for the
gtk_widget_render_icon call()

I am not sure if the signal handler needs to be freed on data-free. That field
is marked with FIXME. It seems to work with or without but maybe I just don't
know how to trigger a doesn't work scenario :)

Great, thanks, I have a couple of comments:

- gdk_pixbuf_scale_simple returns a newly created pixbuf, so this leaks memory:

static void
showdesktop_update_icon (ShowDesktopData * sdd, int size)
{
    GdkPixbuf *pb = gdk_pixbuf_copy (sdd->icon);

    gdk_pixbuf_scale_simple (pb, size, size, GDK_INTERP_BILINEAR);
    xfce_scaled_image_set_from_pixbuf (XFCE_SCALED_IMAGE (sdd->image), pb);
    g_object_unref (G_OBJECT (pb));
}

- also, the purpose of the scaled image is to scale automatically, so this is
not needed at all. You can simple create the image once and set the size of the
button.

- If all you want to do in the set_size callback is change the button size, you
don't need to do anything, since this is the default behavior if there is no
callback.

- A question: what happens when a user manually de-iconifies a window? Does the
window manager reset the 'show desktop' state? In that case we need to reset the
button as well, I guess.

Subject: Importing xfce4-xfapplet-plugin
Message-ID: <20060124023948.GA11849@icablenet.com.br>

Hi,

I'm new to this list and I'm also the developer of the plugin for
displaying gnome applets in the Xfce panel (xfce4-xfapplet-plugin - I've
made an announcement a few days ago on the xfce4-dev list). I'd like to
import the plugin in the xfce-goodies repository, so I'd like to know if
there is any procedure I must follow in order to do this or if it is
just about creating the directories
xfce4-xfapplet-plugin/{trunk,branches,tags} under the root svn directory
and importing the sources.

Regards,
Adriano

You can have a look here:
https://developer.berlios.de/docman/display_doc.php?docid=394&group_id=2#newssh

Basically, it is creating a new directory called xfce4-xfapplet-plugin/ under the xfce-goodies one, just as you said.

Also you must be able to release a tarball and post them in the download section. For that, get logged into berlios and go to the xfce-goodies
page. On the left, You have something like this :

Project: Goodies for the Xfce desktop
R?sum? du Projet
Forums de Discussion
Submit Bugs
Request Support
Request Features

Admin. du Projet


Go to the "Admin. du Projet" part. Then on the top of the  page, you have the "Edit/Release Files" menu. Go there and then you can click on quick-release a file and follow the instruction. Just know that you will also have to upload your tarball in the berlios ftp at:
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/incoming/.

I've added it to SVN with a couple of changes: free resources, use the action
menu that is available from libxfcegui4, make it a toggle button and add a menu
positioning function (copied from the menu plugin). Thanks a lot for the port.
