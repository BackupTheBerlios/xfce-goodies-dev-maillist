Please take a look at

nice
to get them included in SVN.

Subject: Autogenerated files in SVN
Message-ID: <44593056.9050108@unix-ag.uni-siegen.de>

I'm not sure who's responsible for the goodies SVN repo currently, but I
noticed that the repo contains quite a lot of autogenerated files, i.e.

 - Makefile.in (in various folders)
 - configure
 - config.h.in
 - aclocal.m4
 - compile
 - depcomp
 - install-sh
 - intltool-*.in
 - missing
 - mkinstalldirs

and some other files. What is the reason to keep them in the repo?

Benedikt

Yeah, and config.status presence in the folder doesnt like at all at
dpkg-buildpackage. And lintian complains next :)

a second opinion. 

Thanks for all your advice anyway,

(For anyone on the goodies-dev list that missed the start of the thread
I am looking for someone to test the wavelan plugin for the 4.4beta1
panel as it doesn't work with my wireless card)

If it worked with the old panel, then it should work as well now. Maybe
someone else with a Linux laptop and xfce 4.4 can have a look at this.
Otherwise I'll see to this during the next weeks when I get some spare
time to setup 4.4 on a linux laptop.

I can test it on the campus next monday. I have a Thinkpad (with
Centrino, ipw2200) and just compiled the wavelan plugin successfully.

mocha...

I think we should wait with this until Xfce 4.4 is released. We need
people to work on this and we might have more time after the release
than we have now. My ideas are:

  1. Create goodies.xfce.org, install a customized DokuWiki (similar
     to the one Benny's using for Thunar) and create pages for each
     goodie (DokuWiki allows for easy management of user accounts, I
     think).

  2. Create a SVN root-level repository, so we have

        /xfce4
        /goodies
        /www

  3. Create bugzilla sections for the goodies and set up permissions
     and assign rules for goodie developers here as well.

Regards,
Jannis

Hello, list

When path to flag images for xfce4-xkb-plugin contain upper-case characters, images don't show.

There is a little patch correction this issue.

Hi there.

Thanks for the patch. I haven't tried it yet, but does it really
fix the issue? It looks like it still converts the layout name to
lower case.

i install xfce (and other desktop stuff) with prefix "/usr/GTK".
with original xkb plugin complete path transform to "/usr/gtk/share/xfce4/xkb/flags" instead of "/usr/GTK/share/xfce4/xkb/flags"

to_lower() must be applied only for xkb group, not for all path.

Interesting, I didn't know this plugin...
I can probably do the port of this plugin myself(even if I don't have much time these days), 
but I think that the first thing to do is to take contact with the guy who wrote this 
(seems to be Emanuele Rocca <ema at debian.org>) in order to know his feeling about this. If he agreed, I will
do it ;).

The battery icon doesn't resize.  This means that the panel cannot be smaller
than about 32 pixels and when it's larger, the battery plugin just looks funny.

Subject: System load plugin port to Solaris
Message-ID: <1147251614.4461ab9eee04c@ssl0.ovh.net>

Dear all,

I have completed the port of the system load plugin (0.3.6) to Solaris. This
plugin has also been packaged and will be available from blastwave.org in th
enext days (currently in testing area).

I would like to submit my patches to add Solaris support. Since it's the first
time i submit some code to XFce, i would like to know the right way to do it :)

Please tell me, or should i send .patch to the list ?

I will port the latest version of the plugin soon. I am currently working on the
Solaris packaging of 4.4 beta 1.

Kind regards,
William

------- Comment #1 from nick at xfce.org  2006-05-10 17:07 UTC -------
I'm working on a new battery plugin (using HAL). You can find it here:

http://www.foo-projects.org/~nick/plugins/xfce4-battery-plugin-0.0.1.tar.bz2
http://www.foo-projects.org/~nick/plugins/xfce4-battery-plugin.png

Maybe it's good to replace the current battery plugin with this one since it'll
fix a lot of acpi/apm problem and the panel resize problem.

Gr. Nick

Is it a good idea to keep the same name if it's different software ? Or to
restart version numbering ? Shouldn't you change the name or bump the current
plugin version ?

------- Comment #3 from nick at xfce.org  2006-05-10 17:56 UTC -------
Well the idea of the plugin is the same of cource, so it would be a bit
misleading to change the software name and the version numbers is only 0.0.1 to
make clear it's not finished yet, but this will (if it's going to replace the
current plugin) change to 4.0.0 or maybe 5.0.0.

The biggest problem atm is the lack of tester to give me some feedback.

I've installed it, I'll test it for some days and report any bug I find. But,
first, the plugin doesnt resize the panel, it keeps the right size, but the
progressbar doesn't have the same size as other one.

See screenshot attached for details.

Hmh, ok, the plugin doesnt work at all, it reports 100% / on AC, even when
using battery, and battery is discharged.

I'm using pmu and apm emulation, don't know if it's a problem.

I've just uploaded the 0.0.2 version, this should fix some problem with other
laptops. You can compare the output of the plugin with lshal | grep battery. If
it different please attach or send me the lshal output and some lshal -m output
(wait a couple of minutes).

This version needs libxfce4util 4.3.90.2 (beta 2 ??) which I don't have and
don't want to install svn versions, so I'll test it another time.

Uhm, before replacing the old plugin, the new plugin should atleast support all
the platforms that were supported by the previous one.

I've uploaded 0.0.3 without this dependancy. There is a BUGS file to explaing
how to report bugs (and compare / test the plugin with lshal).

Of cource, but most of the platform support is for HAL now isn't it?

Tried 0.0.3.

Infos stay at what they were when plugin was loaded (here, 95% charged). And
progressbar still doesnt have the same size as other ones.

Works fine here. I always had "98%" in the plugin tooltip - I don't
know what that means, but apart from that, everything worked fine and
the green/white/red bars were displayed correctly.

The plugin builds and load fine. Though, when selecting eth1, which is
my airport card, it reports "No such wavelan device".

------- Comment #15 from nick at xfce.org  2006-05-15 07:50 UTC -------
Released test version 0.0.5, some HAL fixes and it
seems to work for Corsac now.

http://foo-projects.org/~nick/plugins/xfce4-battery-plugin-0.0.5.tar.bz2

I'm going to finish the plugin now so it will support (most) of the
current battery plugin stuff. If people still have problems with
HAL please fill a bug report or send me an email.
The following version will have a version number like 0.5.x.

Nick

Now the plugin works here. The only thing (yet seen with nick) is the time
format displayed next to the progress bar.

Currently it's minutes:seconds, while in tooltip it's ##hr ##min.

A format like "hours:minutes" would be better, I guess.

Could you please provide a backport patch (if possible, both for 4.2 and 4.4
plugins ;) ) so we won't have to wait for the next beta to fix this annoying
bug.

I don't reopen it because there is no reason :)

Thanks.

just remove the configure, inltool, Makefile.in etc etc?

Perhaps because most of the plugin writers doesn't take care of removing them?
At least, it was the case for me. But we can probably drop them from trunk.

The patches need to add Solaris support are availables from my website. 
You will find the patches at the following URL :

http://wbonnet.net/xfce/patches-systemload-0.3.6

There are four modified .c files :

http://wbonnet.net/xfce/patches-systemload-0.3.6/cpu.c.patch
http://wbonnet.net/xfce/patches-systemload-0.3.6/memswap.c.patch
http://wbonnet.net/xfce/patches-systemload-0.3.6/systemload.c.patch
http://wbonnet.net/xfce/patches-systemload-0.3.6/uptime.c.patch

I added French support by using the .po file from the XFce 4.4b1 version 
of the plugin.

Modified file is configure.ac :

http://wbonnet.net/xfce/patches-systemload-0.3.6/configure.ac.patch

Translation file is :

Message-ID: <148673630605250827v6631d327l345a97094ab36f8c@mail.gmail.com>

I was wondering if anyone has considered the implementing something in the
xfce-mount panel plugin that would allow the user to specify a command to
use for mounting and also for unmounting?  The reason I ask is that I use
ivman to automount removeable media, but in order to unmount it the pumount
command is needed from pmount, umount doesn't work.  So I figured it would
make things easier if this was an option for the plugin so people don't need
the command line to unmount removable media.

The Xfce 4.4 Beta1 xfce4-mount-plugin-0.4.5 has an option to
"specify own commands for mounting/unmounting". So, I guess you should try
the latest version from
Berlios<http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=910>on
Beta1 <http://www.xfce.org/archive/xfce-4.3.90.1/>.

Failed to apply, see bugzilla. Btw, who maintains the quicklauncher
plugin? The AUTHORS file says Nicolas, but the bug was automatically
assigned to Jasper.

Looks like the systemload maintainer is currently unavailable. Right
now, we're in the process of moving the goodies to xfce.org. I'll apply
your patches once the move is done.
