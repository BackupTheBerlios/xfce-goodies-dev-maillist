   Hi all,

   Here's the new version of the xmms panel plugin for XFCE 4. Patrick van 
Staveren was the author of the original plugin. Later I took over and 
Mario Streiber has joined (and almost entirely rewritten the code from 
scratch).

   Last time when I submitted version 0.2.1, I didn't get any response from 
the xfce-goodies-dev team, and the the webpage wasn't updated. Do I need 
to send it to another address as well? I hope this time it gets updated, 
as the change is big. Some new features (compared to the original one by 
Staveren):

  * A (hideable) scrolling song title. You can make font size and speed 
adjustments.
  * A clickable progressbar to see and set track position.
  * Mousewheel up/down changes volume.
  * A (hideable) volume bar.

  Enjoy!

Very good to hear you picked up the development of this plugin. Sorry for not
responding before. My time is extremely limited these days :(

Right, are you a member of the xfce-goodies project? If so you can make a file
release yourself. If not, you need to get an acount on
http://developer.berlios.de and send me your login name, so that I can add you
to the project. You'll get access to the CVS and you'll be able to do file
releases.

Alright, I have added you to the project. I think it will take some time for
berlios to update your permissions. You should be able to commit your changes
to CVS soon and create file releases. Let me know off-list if you want me to
help you out with this.

And, of course, welcome ;-)

Nice work guys! Work fine here. Perhaps just 2 little things: 
- Is it possible to do so that the rule can be hided to?
- Also something else who would be great would be to not only make this plugin work 
with xmms but also with other players like bmp or mpd.

If you want, I think I can help you, but not these days since I'm in exams next week.... :-(

Hiding the progressbar is easy. This weekend I'll upload a version where 
you have an option to hide it.

As for the latter request; that shouldn't be hard; at least codewise. 
Instead of just xmmsctrl.h we're going to use a couple of other header 
files and play control commands. What I would need help about is writing 
suitable configure scripts. We need to check whether these players exist 
and then compile the corresponding files. And Xavier had an issue with 
pango; since we haven't added a Pango check to configure. The current 
script is the same as Staveren's except the version number. Today I looked 
at the documentation of autoconf and automake; and I don't think I'll be 
able to understand it soon :).

B.t.w, Xavier: You need Pango >= 1.8.0 I think, this issue had come up in 
the 0.2.1 version as well. I haven't yet gotten the digest so I can't 
reply to your message now.

Hello!

Another suggestion is to be able to NOT show the title of the song. I'm 
using a rather thing   panel, which means i have to choose a very small 
font for the song title, making it impossible to read.. so i could just 
skip it completely :)
Perhaps make all of the components optional? even the play/pause/stop 
and so on.

The scrolled song title can be hidden in the options menu.

Well, if that's the intention for that option, it does not work.
That switch just tells the plugin not to SCROLL the text, and not to 
remove it.

I mean that checkbox in the options dialog that's labelled "Show scrolled song title". If I clear the checkbox, the song title disappears.

There seems to be a problem with the initialization which we should fix. The song title is shown at first although the check box is cleared. But if you activate it and then deactivate it again, the song title disappears. At least on my box.

I confirm that. I found also another little problem: when title is not show, this is impossible to have an acces to the config dialog. Seems this is because the signal is only connected to the title and not to the rule and the commands.

You're right. There's still room for improvement :-) We'll check this soon.

That option in preferences is working correctly here, too. I'm using the 
latest gtk btw.

As for the "options" dialog: You can also click on the tiny space between 
two buttons, so even without the title you should be able to open the 
dialog. The signal handler is connected to ctrl->base, not just the title. 
I've experimented with that, and tries severeal other things like putting 
an eventbox around the main box widget etc. None worked like I want, but 
we can keep tinkering of course...

Hi!

Hm, have you tried restarting xfce to see if it still is not showing?
I managed to remove the title at first, but when i rebooted it was still 
there, even though i've unchecked "Show scrolled song title".

  It will take forever to wait for the list digest, so I'm replying to my 
own message.

  I'm attaching the new file which includes a correction for the bug that 
Erik mentioned (show title option is now correctly read from config).

  I'll upload the new package to CVS this weekend (possibly Sunday) and it 
will also include an option to hide the progressbar. Do you think making 
the buttons hideable is necessary? The plugin would not be very useful 
without those. Or something like show on mouse over? Could be useful for 
small/medium panels.

Subject: mount-plugin 0.2 requires gtk 2.6
Message-ID: <200506051852.33448.rstmp@iinet.com.au>

Hi,

I wanted to try the mount plugin and downloaded its current latest version 
(0.2). Unfortunately it didn't work on my gtk-2.4-setup system, which doesn't 
support calls to new functions such as gtk_label_set_width_chars().

I think the gtk-2.6 requirement should be explicitly indicated in the plugin's 
Changes / Release Notes, so people don't try to download it if it's not going 
to work on their own system.

Cheers,
Roger

PS	I couldn't find an entry for this plugin in Bugzilla.

Hi all,

is there some way to automatically mount hotplug devices (USB sticks, CD-ROM's etc) in xfce? How are you guys using these devices?

I am using Ubuntu Linux, and I haven't found a way to make such devices show up in /etc/fstab. Gnome or KDE detect them automatically and create a desktop icon, but what about xfce?

I've got gnome-volume-manager starting up whenever I launch Xfce.

Then again, if nautilus isn't your file manager of choice.... :-)

Thanks for the hints. HAL is already installed. Unfortunately both hal-device-manager and gnome-volume-manager say hald is not running. hal-device-manager tells me

  Could not get device list. Make sure hald is running!

And gnome-volume-manager says

  libhal.c 767 : org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NoReply raised
  "No reply within specified time"


  ** (gnome-volume-manager:10537): WARNING **: manager.c/1205: seems that HAL is not running

but hald is running:

hal       5926     1  1 08:02 ?        00:07:33 /usr/sbin/hald --drop-privileges



What am I doing wrong?

Subject: Panel plugin howto?
Message-ID: <42A4ADFE.8030805@home.se>

Hello!

I'm interested in making plugins for the xfce panel, but there are a few 
questions/obstacles i need help with. It would be perfect is someone 
could make a little howto to get noobs like me started :)

The howto could handle stuff like autoconf (perhaps this is OT, if it is 
i'd like to know where to learn it).
Other things could be a more informative example than the sample plugin.
Perhaps a step-by-step guide on how the sample plugin was created?

Oh, another question.. is C a must, or can i develop in C++ aswell?

I realize that making such a howto could take a lot of time, but i think 
that more people than me would like to get started.

Regards,
Erik

   Hi all,

   Version 0.3.1 can now be downloaded from the Berlios project page:

   http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=910

   It includes the fix for remembering the song title visibility. Also 
added an option to hide the track position progressbar. Finally one little 
change to support BMP. Actually the older versions work with BMP, too -- 
an already running BMP can be controlled by this plugin. Also, the 
configure script now checks for pango >= 1.8.0. Enjoy!

   Ilgar

I think making a how-to would be a good think for
everyone. But for now, what you can do is looking at
others plugins sources. 
Also, there is a good tutorial available at
http://xfc.xfce.org/docs/tutorial/html/chapter08.html.
(but remember you want to do a panel-plugin,not an XFC
app ;) )
Now for C or C++... I think since gtk (used by Xfce)
is done in C, using C is better. But now, if you want
to use C++, you can. (from my point of view, it
depends on what you want to do and on how big it is).

It maybe because D-Bus is not working...
Hal makes use of dbus...
konqueror uses hal for removable devices.

ALright, this is great (sorry for the late reply). So, does anybody know if we
can close the CVS? I don't think it's a good idea to have both open for
development.

The best way to do this is copy the relevant files from one of the existing
plugins.

C is a requirement. A plugin is a dynamically loaded library and becomes part
of the panel. This may change in the future.

Probably yes. I may do it one day, but that's not any time soon.

Actually it is possible to use C++ in combination with the 'extern "C"'
environment and some glue functions. I've succesfully coded a plugin in
c++ which loads into the panel, although i got some linking errors when
I use inheritance. 

Another thing i still have to find out is how to get autoconf to use the
g++ compiler for my plugin, does anyone know something about how to do
this?

Message-ID: <1118349970.11496.4.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hi,

I've seen different behavior of battpanel on two different laptops.
One showed the temperature, the other didn't.
The culprit is:
in libacpi.c there it only tries to open
  /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/temperature
while on the 2nd laptop it has to be
  /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/ATF0/temperature

By looking at the source I saw that it also checks for the fan.
I made a change there as well.

Here is a simple patch:

It seems there is a problem with my CD-RW drive. After a burn failure it ended up in an unusable state, making hal unresponsive. The only way out was a reboot. At least I didn't find another way to reset the CD drive.

gnome-volume-manager is indeed what I want. When I plug in my camera it will mount it silently.

I am ;)

But as I'm currently busy with another project of my own besides
university, anyone is free to add it, especially you ;)

But on the other hand, it's not too much work, p'haps I'll add it in the
next days...

Added in trunk, but untested as I don't get it into the panel right now.

Hi all!

The required option is now available from the svn-repository.
Thus, version 0.4 is out with some small textual clean-ups - sorry to
all translators ;)

Btw, there is still help needed concerning i18n - I don't get it display
my preferred language though I created the translation files.

Besides, who is responsible for creating new archives of the panel
plugins and making them publicly available?

Greetings, Fabian

Meanwhile even  version 0.5.0 is released in trunk...

Its main improvements are to display voltages as 1.70 V, fan speed as
3960 rpm and temperatures as 50.5 ?C.

Please send futher requests to this list.

Hello!

Also I cannot login with my user/password anymore.
What shall I do?

I received the same message but:

1) note that there is a zip archive attached, named password.zip. I did
not open it so I don't know what it contained, but I suspected malicious
code since it didn't make sense for berlios to send me a zip archive
containing a password.

2) My password on the berlios web site still works fine.

Hello!

The attachment 'updated-password.zip' contents an Windows Executable

It's annoying, this night I received another 2 emails with a similar

I use usbmount [1] on my Debian System.  Mounts usb and firewire devices
as soon as you plug them in using hotplug, I'm not sure, if you can use
it with cd-roms.

Subject: Planning for for 4.4 panel
Message-ID: <1119170655.4777.22.camel@localhost>

Hi all,

I just want to dump some thoughts about developments for the 4.4 panel.
The idea is to have the new features implemented somewhere in august.

The two important high-level goals for the panel are:

1) Multiple panels. Taskbar and iconbox become instances of the panel.

2) Out-of-process plugins. This should protect the panel from problems 
   in plugins (mem-leaks and crashes). 

I believe that to do this properly I will have to rewrite the plugin
interface more or less completely. This is necessary to get rid of
references to global variables.

So, how to go about this? 

- Create a (GObject based) plugin implementation with interface 
  completely separate from panel internals.

- Port all plugins (from the panel and from the goodies) to the new 
  interface.

- Implement support for multiple panels.

- Implement support for out-of-proces plugin, with the same interface
  as in-process plugins.

We could always decide to skip the last or even the last two points for
4.4 and implement those for 4.6 if time is running short.

Does this sound reasonable or are there better ways to handle this?

	Jasper

Yes there's a lot of spam coming round, most of them with a suspicious zip attachment.

Hi,

My system reckons it is a virus: Worm.Mytob.CW

Some info I got from the Net regarding MyTob:
<<
Mass-mailing worm with back door capabilities that uses its own SMTP engine to 
send email to addresses that it gathers from the compromised computer.
The worm also spreads by exploiting the Microsoft Windows Local Security 
Authority Service Remote Buffer Overflow (as described in Microsoft Security 
Bulletin MS04-011) and the Microsoft Windows DCOM RPC Interface Buffer 
Overrun Vulnerability (as described in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-026).

Right, so is there anything we can do about this? Closing the list and
creating a new one could be an option, but maybe a bit drastic ;-) Any
ideas?

I also need to find out why I don't receive these messages anymore...
(reading/posting through gmane now).

Hi,

Closing the list and creating a new one could be an option... for now. What 
about in a month time? Couldn't we be reached by a virus/worm again.

I guess the best thing would be that the list have an anti-virus filter in 
input.
I personally use clamav and am pretty happy with it. So far all viruses have 
been stopped (quarantined) before reaching my mailbox.

Cheers,
Roger

I'm also receiving similar messages from various other sources, for 
example from mail at xfce.org. So I don't think that closing a particular 
list would solve the problem. The best solution would be to shot the 
spammer responsible for this messages. ;)

Oh, ok. Could the real spammer please stand up? ;-)

Btw, the reason I don't receive list mail anymore seems to be that espreso
(the Xfce server) is blacklisting berlios ;-)

Hello everyone,

I am very new to the list and I am sorry for intruding.  I was
wondering if anyone has been working on a mail notification xfce-panel
plugin for GMail.   I recently noticed that Google has an Atom XML
interface (https://mail.google.com/mail/feed/atom) where you can find
out if you have new messages.

Anyway, as far as I can tell, there is no xfce panel plugin currently
that handles GMail, but I think it would be a great addition.

If no one is working on it, I would like to get my hands dirty at it.

Thanks,
Ralph

That's a very good idea!

Hello,

Why bother with such a "narrow" plugin? Wouldn't it be better to extend 
the mail checker plugin to support pop3 over SSL? (gmail supports pop3 
access too)

I may not be sure on what you mean by "narrow", but some of the other
Xfce plugins that I have seen so far seem to do very specific tasks
(i.e. weather), and a theoretical gmail plugin does not seem to be all
that different.

Don't get me wrong, I think pop3 support (with and without SSL) in the
mail checker is also a good idea.  I just do not use pop3 with gmail
(only the web interface), so it never really occurred to me to use
that option.

With that said, maybe both ideas could be implemented.  I personally
think that the RSS/Atom feed was an interesting method of
notification, so I was naturally drawn to it.

Hi everybody

After a long long time..I found some time and experience in C, so i 
rewrote the taskmanager.
Now I've got a runnable version (not a release ;) ) for linux.
It would be nice to have some feedback :)

So download it under:

Check it out and reply :-D

I'm not sure if I understand what 'out-of-process' means. Does this
mean each plugin will be it's own application, just like with
gnome-panel? Because that's one of the things I *really* hate about
the gnome-panel. Run a bunch of 'plugins' and your memory usage rises
to incredible heights.

I hope I'm wrong, but if not then I strongly discourage you to do this.

Please don't bloat XFCE... :(

Hi everybody,

Forget the last 2 Mails from me.
The new Release 0.3.0 of the xfce4-taskmanager is now available on 
http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=910

It is completly rewritten and has now more functionality, like showing 
user,root,other tasks.

Check it out and write feedback if bugs appear :-D

Look quiet better. Package for Mandriva 2005LE is ready ;-)

There seems to be a bug. I use "more options" and try to sort processes 
my used memory. It not correctly sorts them. Processes with >100MB are 
listed above 10MB but between it?s not correct sortet. The list can be 
12MB 24MB 13MB...

Try to fix it.

Can you integrate cpu usage per process? Then it would be quiet as 
complete as top.
