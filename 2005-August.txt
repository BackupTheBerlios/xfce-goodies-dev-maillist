Greetings.

I'm using debian testing and installed libsensors3 and libsensors-dev.
Compiled and installed ok. But, when I run xfce4-panel, it gives-me the
folowing output.

** Message: xfce4-panel: module minicmd successfully loaded

** (xfce4-panel:19500): WARNING **: xfce4-panel: module
/usr/lib/xfce4/panel-plugins/libsensors.so cannot be opened
(/usr/lib/xfce4/panel-plugins/libsensors.so: undefined symbol:
control_class_set_unique)
** Message: xfce4-panel: module wavelan successfully loaded

I've added /usr/lib/xfce4/panel-plugins to ld.so.conf and run depmod -a.
And it still gives me the same message.
Can you help me tracing the problem?

Thanks.

versions: xfce, libsensors?

which version of hwsensors-plugin are you using? try using
xfce4-sensors-plugin v0.6.1 from xfce-goodies.berlios.de.

control_class_set_unique is an xfce-panel call to disallow the plugin to
be loaded twice into the panel.
so installing xfce4.2.* from os-works.com might help.

other "unique" plugins should also cause problems, like the clock and
volume plugin, if it's due to the xfce libs.

bye, fabian

Ah. Got it.
My sensors-plugin is 0.6.1, but xfce4-panel is version 4.0.6-1.
As I don't like much to "confuse" the system with mixed versions of the
same software, I will mantain current xfce4 installed (and let debian
install a new version when "he" wants to) and try an older version of
sensors-plugin.

BTW, how about adding a line in configure.ac to check current xfce4
version. If there is such limitation, the users should be warned.

Many thanks for the help.

no prob, but please help us: did you try the newer clock and volume
plugins and also get this behavior or did they still work properly?

so let's assign this "configure.ac task" to a person being more capable
to handle that auto* stuff than me - what about you?

btw., as a debian user myself, i somehow doubt that debian itself will
provide xfce4.2++ packages one day...

I use mostly plugins from the deb tree. I only compiled that because
it's not in the deb testing tree. You people were talking a lot about it
and I surely wanted to give it a try.
Datetime is version 0.3.1 and it works ok.
The volume plugin, xfce4-mixer, is version 4.0.6-1. Also ok.

Ok. I'll look around about that. You'll hear from me soon. (real soon.)

You know debian's lemma. "Debian releases when it's time [and there is a
total alignment with 45% of all planets of the solar system (including
planet X), and non of them has on his name the third letter of the
developer name that has a white, blue or yellow t-shirt given by a
younger daughter of one's brother or sister or of the brother or sister
of one's spouse that has an a child of a first cousin living on a state
with at least 7 letters on it's name]". It's quite simple and regular. :-)
(To better understand this joke, refer to "Monty Python" in "The meaning
of Life".)

Now, seriously. I'm using debian testing. On unstable, I'll find
xfce4.2.2. But I stopped using unstable when I found apache2 rendered
unusable. So, I guess I'll keep using 4.0 for a while. Not before
xfce4.2 jumps to testing (or stable, but that... huh.. yeah. :-] ).

Ok. This was quicker than I expected. But I need you to test it on a
"ok" enviroment. On mine, it fails as it is suposed to do.
Apply the folowing patch:

***begin patch***

+++ configure.ac        2005-08-02 01:04:39.000000000 +0100

+       exit -1
+])
+
 dnl configure the panel plugin
 XFCE_PANEL_PLUGIN([XFCE4_PANEL], [4.0.0])


***end patch*

Run 'autoconf' on the directory and test with './configure'. On mine,
fails with:
checking for sensors_get_detected_chips in -lsensors... yes
checking for control_class_set_unique... no
Error! You need to upgrade xfce4 to 4.2
mini-me:/usr/src/svn/xfce4-sensors-plugin/trunk#

On a xfce4.2 system, it should go ok till the end of ./configure.

Tomorow I'll be unable to read e-mail during day. I'll try to see the
e-mail on the end of the day (22:00 GMT).

Thanks for all.

Ehm, how about using 'XFCE_PANEL_PLUGIN([XFCE4_PANEL], [4.2.0])' instead?

This won't work, as it only checks for control_class_set_unique in all 
libraries listed in $LIBS (plus the system libraries determined by the 
AC_LANG).

As Jasper suggested, use XFCE_PANEL_PLUGIN([XFCE4_PANEL], [4.2.0]).

btw, debian packages of 0.6.1 (for unstable) are currently in work -
eventually they might get through to testing.

Hi!

Having found some hours of spare time, I created a GDM theme based on an xfce wallpaper and the Rodent and hicolor icon themes, so it realy gives the xfce flair to any GDM user ;)

You can find the theme at http://www.xfce-look.org/content/show.php?content=27429 or download it directly from http://mitglied.lycos.de/timshome/download/gdm-xfce_0.1.tar.bz2 .

Maybe it's also interesting for xfce-artowrk despite its size of more than 900KB.

Feel free to suggest changes, improvements or patches; it's the only way to improve it (if necessary?).

Greets, Fabian

:-(. The main problem for me is that I can't reproduce the bug. What's your glib/gtk version? What' s also your version of XFCE (and libxfcegui)? does this bug happens on other prog? (Can you try to change the icon of the xfce manu plugin in the panel to see if it works?). I would like to help you, but for now i'm just unable to see where this bug does comes from. (oh and also I forgot, did you restart the panel after reinstalling the plugin?) 

Ps:I have cc the xfce-goodies-dev lists since this discussion can interrest them (and perhaps can they provide some help).

Hello Nicolas,

meanwhile, I tested the plugin on another Suse 9.2 32Bit system (xfce 
4.2.1).
Do you want to know the result??
It is the same phenomenon like on my system :-(

If I have time I will test your plugin on a debian linux machine.

Hello,

today I released 0.3.3 of the netload plugin:

2005-08-21 Bernhard Walle
        * Fixed memory leak (thanks to Brian J. Tarricone)
        * Custom bar colors now also work with special Gtk theme engine
          where the previous code doesn't work (thanks to Brian J.
          Tarricone)
        * Fixed bug that causes an invalid displayed string if no device
          name was set.
        * Released 0.3.3.

@Ilkka: Can you sync apt repository? (Not only netload, there are some
minor modifications of other packages.)


Regards,
 Bernhard

Subject: Notes plugin - when does it save?
Message-ID: <4308FE4C.1060302@aptanet.com>

I've just had a minor run in with the notes plugin. I seem to remember
when I first started usign it being surprised that it retained so much
data over an X restart - i.e. it seemed to keep the data but lose the
positioning. The other day, however, X was killed (not entirely sure
why, nothing logged and it was over night so I didn't see it happen) and
the last couple of days notes were lost. Not a big issue it terms of
data loss, but it does seem to indicate that any new notes are stored in
memory until you log out - is this correct or have I hit a bug of some
sort. Out of interest is there somewhere I could look for the working
file should I wish to try to recover the missing notes? (no doubt
overwritten now if there is one in this case!).

Well I'm subscribed here now.

I've mailed the existing maintainer of the weather app. to see if he's
happy with me taking over.

I'll download the plugin software in due course and take a look to see
if it makes any sense to me at all.

How is development done usually for this code?  I see that Berlios
offers ssh access, I'm very used to that, I have ssh working from work
to home and from home to work.  I also access this system where I read
my E-Mail by ssh.

How is CM done?
