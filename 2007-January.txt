Subject: Who is feeling responsible for the fsguard-plugin?
Message-ID: <45A3EE4E.7060101@s1999.tu-chemnitz.de>

Hi readers,

I want to improve (i.e. already started with it) the fsguard plugin with
two features:
- Display remaining space as text in panel (as option)
- Allow usage of free-space bar graph instead of "colored box"

I found the current source code at svn.xfce.org and started local
modification from there, but I did not found out who is maintaining the
SVN and the plugin itself.

I mailed to the developers named in AUTHORS and Andre Lerche told me he
started the plugin, but currently discontinued work.

Thus, anybody currently maintaining the plugin or can give me a hint who
to ask in this case?


Thanks & (still, very late dough) a Happy New Year,
Robert

First: please use the goodies-dev at xfce.org ml, Berlios is not used anymore.

Second, great you want to maintain this plugin, because I think nobody
if atm. If you want svn access please contact sofar at foo-projects.org.

Greets,
Nick

Ah, thanks. I will change to there. Just, on www.xfce.org the berlios ML
is still listed, see
http://www.xfce.org/index.php?page=mailinglists&lang=en

Who to ask to fix this?


Cu,
Robert

If I may be so bold to suggest some things:

* Use only one instance of the fsguard plugin
* Ability to add a virtually unlimited amount of mounts-to-check
* Ability to select which mount should also be presented as 'bar graph'
* Use (xfce4-)notification-daemon for warnings/errors (every <user 
defined> minutes)

I have about 7 to 9 mounts to monitor; enough to fill an entire panel of 
fsguard plugins... And it would be cool to actually use the notification 
daemon once-in-a-while ;)

Cheers!

Harold.

Hi

Sorry, I'm one of the mentioned authors but was rather busy these last
days. If you feel like maintaining the plugin, just go ahead. I mainly
jumped in to prevent it from getting orphaned and am not particularly
keen on supporting yet another project. If you're not interested, I
would however be willing to keep doing it.

Regards
Stefan

I already started this, however I stopped at the "orientation" stuff, I
will need to get a clean head on this.  With options for both.  Actually
I even had like to get rid of the button.  Not really worth to open
Thunar IMHO (oh, and changed the default file manager to exo-open IIRC).

See:

http://foo-projects.org/pipermail/goodies-dev/2006-December/000413.html

I also have get an answer from the former maintainer.

However, as I am short at time, go ahead and post your patch on the
goodies-dev ml.  BTW this ml (@berlios.de) is outdated.

% dpkg -S /usr/include/pcre.h                      [07-01-22-1:13]
libpcre3-dev: /usr/include/pcre.h

Obviously you need to install the dev package (whatever way it is called
on your system) for libpcre.

Hi Mike,

thats it, after installing the package libpcre3-dev all works fine.
On the main-site i have seen a list, what packages are needed for
installing xfce4 4.4.0.
I think it seems helpful to publish a list of the dependencies from the
goodies-installer to.

Yeah, i think xfce4 is a great job, my gratulations :-))


Best Regards

Andreas

Subject: Clipman 'select text in xterm' issue (Forwarded)
Message-ID: <45BCC57D.3000702@home.nl>

(Forwarded from xfce-dev list...)

Dear list,

To my understanding, the Xfce Clipboard manager has the option to merge 
the 'X' clipboard with the 'selection' clipboard.

When selecting text in X, the selected (or copied with ctrl-c) text is 
immediately paste-able in an xterm using shift-insert.
The other way around: Selecting text in an xterm isn't paste-able in X, 
unless explicitly selected from the 'Clipman History'. The 'Clipman 
History' also shows 2 active clipboard items... (see attachment)

Update: A VTE-based terminal doesn't fix this...


Is this the expected behavior or a bug?


Cheers!

Harold
