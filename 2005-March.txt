           Summary: Panel does not autohide when klicking on a grouped task
           Product: Xfce Panel Plugins
           Version: unspecified
          Platform: PC
        OS/Version: Linux
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
          Priority: Medium
         Component: taskbar
        AssignedTo: xfce-goodies-dev at berlios.de
        ReportedBy: mani at access.unizh.ch


Autohiding of the panel does not work, when I click on a task that is grouped
(let's say one instance of firefox or a gimp window). Tested with firefox, gimp,
xterm and kmail. Automatic group is enabled in the taskbar plugin and the panel
is set to autohide.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open several windows of the same application
2. klick on a grouped icon
3. choose one of the tasks

Actual Results:  
the panel does not hide anymore

Expected Results:  
the panel should hide like always

Does it not hide even if you move your mouse on and off the panel again?

I forgot to mention that. Yes, when moving the mouse on and off the panel, it hides.

There's not really anything we can do about that. The menu that pops up from the
grouped task button 'eats' the mouse clicks and movement, so the panel doesn't
know the mouse has moved.

------- Additional Comments From aaron at serendipity.cx  2005-03-02 20:29 UTC -------
I have looked at the source code to battery plugin 0.2.0, and it *should*
account for the second battery in my Thinkpad, but it's only showing the
external battery, which is in /proc/acpi/battery/BAT2. If the external battery
isn't plugged in, then it shows BAT0.

I wonder if there's simply a need for code that checks the other battery if the
current battery runs out? I think a good way to handle this would be to start
checking other batteries once the current battery goes below threshold. A highly
useful message might be:

"The current battery (BAT2) has reached 10%. Don't worry, because another
battery (BAT0) has power. Your system will switch over automatically."

Followed a few hours later by:

"The current battery (BAT0) has reached 10%. Time to panic, because no other
batteries have power, either. Go find an outlet!"

Naturally, we'll have to write some more "friendly, yet firm" language ;-)

Can the panel receive external commands? Then the popup menu would have to tell
the panel somethink like "on click minimize".

Message-ID: <20050303093523.46154.qmail@web12303.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi,
this is to announce the first release of
xfce4-mount-plugin.
The plugin is in a "usable" state and you can get it
now from berlios.de
When clicking on it, it displays a list of available
devices with some usage statistics. These statistics
are refreshed each time you click on the plugin.
Clicking on an unmounted (resp mounted) device will
mount (resp umount) it.
Device names and mount points are gathered from
/etc/fstab through the getfsent() system call. data on
mounted devices comes from gemntent() system call.
The plugin has no configuration options for the
moment. There is no particular action except
mounting/unmounting the device.
This is my very first use of gtk lib and the GNU
autotools, there might be obvious newbie mistakes in
the package, let me know :-)
bye.

I use plugin a little and want to fix such things:

1. Format info in columns (table with 3 columns - device / info /  state)
2. Ability to exclude some  entryies from /dev/fstab -
( like a /, /usr, /var - partitions that always mounted)  or
separate this partitions from others.

But in all very nice plugin

The taskbar is a separate widget, so even the plugin doesn't know about the
menu.  Duplicating the effort of rewriting the tasklist widget does not sound
like a solution to me. If a plugin knows about a menu, it can already register
it and the panel will act appropriately when the menu closes.

I really believe this cannot be fixed in a reasonable manner. If the plugin
maintainer or someone else has a different opinion, please reopen the bug.

I don't want to be a boring guy, but just one last
thing: Can someone create a entry for me in the files
lists called "xfce4-quicklauncher-plugin"? 
This way I can upload my files there. (I have already
uploaded them in the cvs.)
It seems that I don't have rights to create an entry
myself :'( .

Once it will be done, I think I would edit the main
page of the site in order to add my plugin and this
from Jean-Baptiste in. (if someone else want to edit
the main page, please tell me)

        AssignedTo: xfce-goodies-dev at berlios.de
        ReportedBy: plessing at ems-wuensche.com


I use the datetime-plugin more than one time, to split different 
information by a separator ( e.g. Week of Year, date )

After the last update (now I'm using Xfce Version 4.0.6) e.g. the datetime 
plugin was only used to show the Week of Year (Date was "KW %U") and Time 
was left blank, but after xfce was restartet the time-field was set back to its
standard values (%H:%M).



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. set a inputfield of datetime-plugin to blank
2. restart xfce
3. the inputfields, which was left blank are set back to standard values

Actual Results:  
The fields which has been left blank to be unvisible, are shown again.

Expected Results:  
Save the empty values and hide the blank fields as it has done before.

If the field which is wanted to be empty is filled with a space, the 
standard values are not filled back in.
This makes this bug more trivial, and is only a matter of nice formatting ...

I suggest that you use spaces for empty format.
Anyway, I thought that if the user delete whole format string, program should
reset the format string to the default value. But now I don't.
How about make a button in preference window which explicitly reset the format
to the default values?

Adding a "reset"-button to the preferences window is a appropriate

When you untar xfce4-quicklauncher-plugin-0.5.tar.gz it
creates a directory named "xfce4-quicklauncher-plugin".
It would be better if this directory would be named
"xfce4-quicklauncher-plugin-0.5" (with the version number).

Subject: Panel changes for 4.4
Message-ID: <4238245A.8000603@xfce.org>

Hi all,

Sorry for the cross-post, I wasn't sure everyone would be on xfce4-dev.

As most of you may know, I'm planning to make some drastic changes to 
the panel for Xfce 4.4. In fact the changes are so big that you could 
speak of a redesign. To make sure that this design will work well also 
for plugin writers (especially for them even), I'm hoping to get some 
feedback on my initial thoughts about the subject.

I decided to use the excellent Xfce wiki facility for that -- I don't 
even know who provides this for us, but thanks for that -- so anyone can 
add comments.

Please, if you can spare some time, have a look at 
http://www.myoo.de/xfce/index.php/Panel_Design and let me know what you 
think, either here, or personal mail or on the wiki.

Since none of this has actually been coded yet feel free to shoot it 
down completely and suggest alternative designs ;-)

I'm most interested in suggestions for the plugin API; the 
implementation is of secondary concern.

Thanks,
	Jasper

I thought of an idea which I think would be good addition.
Let me put an example - the Xkb or the System buttons
plugins should
be able to be added to the panel just once. It doesn't make
sense to
add two instances of the system buttons (at least IMO).
Other plugins
(as the launcher or netload) should be able to have whatever
number
of instances the user wants to have.

The volume control plugin is IMO a more special case - the
maximum number
of instances of this plugin should be the number of sound
cards in the
machine (e.g. if I have 3 sound cards I should be able to
put 3 volume
controls in the plugin).

These are just some thoughts, but no idea of an actual API.
An API such as:

const gboolean *xfce_panel_plugin_can_add(XfcePanelPlugin
*plugin);

would make some sense, but in this case the plugin should be
able to
determine somehow of there is already an instance added
(e.g. the
xkb plugin).

Another idea I just came with would be to add a flag
in the .desktop file whether multiple instances are
permitted for
the plugin. This way the plugin will know when a plugin
could be added
just once and thus disable ability to add it more than once.
If
the plugin actually can be added more than once and the
plugin
has already been added, then the panel should call
xfce_panel_plugin_can_add() to query the plugin if it could
be added
anymore - e.g. the volume control would return a value of
false if
there already were added instances for all the available
soundcards.

I don't know what could be the implementation for such a
volume
control plugin, I mean I have no idea how could such a
plugin
determine what sound cards already have a corresponding
instance
of the plugin or not. You know, I'm really not that good in
C (this
should be read as - "I must read some good
book/tutorial/whatever" :-)).

I must apologize for the pretty long and very very messy
email.
I'm not king of the explanations also...

So that's about all I came with.

Hey, thanks for the GREAT WORK all xfce team. :)

Alexander

Sorry for tha spam. Just saw a silly mistake in my previous
post.

"This way the plugin will know when a plugin could be added
just once"

should be read as

"This way the panel will know when a plugin could be added
just once"

Hello

1. I don't agree with Alexander's idea for an api that checks if an 
plugin (eg. volume-control) could be added only for a special number. 
Everybody should feel free to add as much systembuttens (eg) as he wants 
to. I mean why to make things difficultier than they are and loos by the 
way some liberties ?
2. I would like to have a better 'position'-concept. the way you can add 
plugins should be done like in the Toolbar of Terminal.
I really love this method ;)

Bye
    Johannes, the_hippie

Some plugins really have to be 'unique', like the systemtray. For those 
(very few) that need this I prefer to put it in the desktop file.

After some thinking (yes, I really do think sometimes :) ),
I would agree
that this will add some uneeded complexity in the plugins
code. I do not
agree with the liberties loss argument - I think from
usability POV it is
much clearer to have limited number of volume control plugin
instances, but
1. I'm not an usability expert, and
2. the complexity argument is strong enough to drop this
idea.

Oh, but you are right about the usability. It is usually better to reduce
confusion as much as possible. Perhaps the volume control /should/ be unique 
and have support for multiple sound cards. 

The trick is to find the right balance between flexibility and ease of use (I
know those are not necessarilly oposites, but you'll get the point...).

I'm not very excited about this idea. The thing I love so
much
in the volume control is the ability to adjust the volume
without
a single click (mouse over, then wheel up/down). If I had
two sound cards I definitely would not want to sacrifice
this
ability.

Or maybe I don't imagine this right. What I mean is that all
the available sound cards should be visible and
volume-adjustable
all the time. If you have an idea how that can be
accomplished
with a single plugin - great. :)

Yes, indeed. The balance is the most important thing. :)

Hehe, that's exactly what I meant, sorry for the confusion. There's no 
reason a single plugin can't have multiple controls.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.61.0503222315450.1463@zeno2.math.washington.edu>


   Hi,

   First of all, congratulations to the XFCE team for their excellent work! 
Here's my tiny contribution:

   I've made several changes to Patrick van Staveren's xmms plugin:

   * Scrolling up/down changes the volume now,
   * There's a progressbar on which you can click to set the track
   position,
   * Song title now scrolls at the top (you can hide/unhide it).

   I'm not a programmer, so don't expect a first-class work :), but it 
seems to run fine. Please check it carefully; I'll happily squash the bugs 
that you find.

   I have several other ideas like optionally having another progressbar 
for volume, maybe additional buttons for xmms file add dialog etc. These 
days I'm quite busy, but hopefully I'll be able to continue the work in 
the (not so far) future.

   Enjoy!

   Ilgar

I'm using Xfce 4.2.1 on gentoo.

Add taskbar plugin to panel, set the "expand to fill screen" option. 
Now change panel size, a strange shuffling-twitching motion is shown.

Try it, it looks rather neat ;)

Yeah, this is a limitation of the current panel API. For Xfce 4.4 it will be
possible to properly set a plugin to expand. Setting this to WONTFIX for 4.2.

Subject: Xkb plugin rewrite
Message-ID: <1111958925.aaeec4f4bcd62@mail.bg>

Hi there.

I'm considering an almost complete rewrite of the xfce4 xkb
plugin. This will probably take some time and since I'm
quite busy at work and at school both these days it's not
clear when exactly it'll be ready. :)

I think I'll implement some new features, of which the main
will be the ability to configure Xkb extension from the
plugin. I think this feature will be of pretty much value
itself, but there are other nice consequences. One of these
would be the ability to show different text/flag image
depending on the layout variant. For example there are two
main Bulgarian layouts available (bds and phonetic) and
currently there is no way to distinguish which of them is
currently selected.

I wonder what will be the most appropriate method of
displaying the alternative layout variants... When the
plugin is configured to display the layout as a flag it
will be nice to have different flag images for each
variant. The default variant I think will use the country
flag itself, but the alternative variants could use the
flag with a small indicator that this is an alternative
layout variant. This is how it's done is Mac OS X. If I
find some time I'll post a screenshot tomorrow. I don't
know if I would break some stupid software patent owned by
Apple (or whoever else) with this.

I still cannot think of some appropriate display of the
variant when selected text indication, as most of the
layout variants are pretty long strings (e.g. the bg
variant "phonetic" mentioned earlier).

I'm open to any kind of comments, suggestions, opinions,
etc. :)

Regards,
Alexander Iliev

Summary: xfce4-weather fails to save weather info in xfce 4.2

Details: Ever since I updated to xfce 4.2 xfce4-weather doesn't load any weather data -- I tried re-selecting the city from the menu, erasing the contents of ~/.xfce4 and ~/.config/xfce4, and restarting xfce4-panel but the tooltip still says "cannot update weather data".

Hei, I thought of another addition to the new API:

gboolean xfce_panel_plugin_test_availability(gchar
**return_msg);

The panel could call this function when a user
selects "Add new item" for each plugin and when
a particular plugin returns FALSE it could be
grayed out (disabled). The plugin would store an
explanation of the reason why it could not be
added this time and it might be displayed somehow
to the user.

Excuse me with all my stupid ideas, but I'm just
trying to think in terms of usability (that's a
VERY VERY modern word these days :-) ) and I think
it's quite more appropriate not to be able to add
some plugin under certain curcumstances than to be
able to add the plugin and it not to function
properly. ;-)

Again, sorry for the crap and for my not very good
english. Just needed to share these thoughts.

Thanks,
Alexander

When you show the properties, you should be able to "set left click action:" to
allow you to run something like "xfterm4 -e htop" or whatever the person wants.

Good idea, but I think it should be sufficient to have a 'Unique = True' 
field in the .desktop file for the plugin. I can't really think of a 
situation where this wouldn't work.

Ok, since this is pretty similar to my previous suggestion
some more explanation would be needed. First - the idea
is pretty different here. It's not about plugin being
unique or not, it's about cheching for certain conditions
which should be fulfilled.

Take for example the xkb plugin. If I run a Xvnc server
and connect to the server there is no XKB extension
available
(Xvnc does not implement XKB). So the xkb plugin could not
function at all. As a result the panel currently crashes.
This is firstly plugin's fault and I'm working on a rewrite
of this plugin which sould handle such situations more
gracefully. I also know that with the new out-of-process
plugins a crash in one plugin should not crash the whole
panel. But nevertheless I think such API would be of help
in making XFCE more user-oriented desktop.

I think having such a function is a good thing, since the
plugin writers can use it to check for certain conditions
needed to run their plugins. If the plugin doesn't depend
on any such conditions or the plugin writer doesn't want to
implement it the simpliest thing is to "return TRUE;". I
think it wouldn't be hard to implement this from the panel
side. It might slow the add new item dialog (or whatever
it will become in the future), but this is pretty rarely
performed task.

Hey, that's just my opinion. :-)
It's up to you, I just think such an API would help in
creating a more "usable" desktop environment.

Best regards,
Alexander

Thanks, that's a very interesting use case. My previous reply may have 
sounded like I didn't agree with the feature, but what I meant was to 
ask you when it would be useful ;-)

I'm trying to keep the interface as small as possible, especially since 
it must be based on sending messages because you can't directly call a 
function in an external plugin. That's why I'll be asking for use cases 
for every API addition and will try to find alternatives that don't 
involve communication.

Anyway, back to your suggestion, there are two situations here that are 
important:

- Add a new plugin.

- Start the panel with an existing configuration in a different environment.

The second on will be much harder to handle, because you do want it to 
show up again the next time you log in to an environment where the 
plugin does work again.

Don't you think it would be better if the plugin would show an error 
icon and/or a dialog explaining the situation, and perhaps offering the 
user to hide and try again in the next session? This would not need 
communication with the panel.

Alternatively what can be done is to do so that the
function responsible of loading the plugin can return
TRUE or FALSE, depending if the plugin was
successfully loaded. If ot is not the case, the plugin
can then dispay why and what was wrong. It seems that
the current panel already work that way... 
The only benefit of Alexander's method (I think) is
that the plugin writer will have to implement the
ask_availability method, when for now nothing is done
to say him that he needs to verify the availability of
some plugin-required components. (Perhaps writing
something like guidelines can help on this point) 

PS: In the case where a plugin fail to load, the panel
can always ask if he must try to load this plugin next
time.

Hehe, just noticed that the panel writer tries to make the plugins do 
the work and the plugin writers try to push the functionality towards 
the panel ;-)

I'll keep it in mind, thanks,

You're absolutely right about the two important
situations - adding a plugin and starting with existing
configuration. And you are also absolutely right about
what should happen in the latter case - the plugin
should show an error icon/message/dialog/whatever to
inform the user that for some reason it could not
function properly. This is plugin's responsibility.

The advantage of the proposed addition is in the case
when the user tries to add a new plugin. In this case
I think it would be more appropriate to disable the
ability to add certain plugins if they could not function
as expected than to add plugins regardless and then
recieve an error message. But I've already said that :).

What I didn't say is - I wasn't aware of the technology
that is about to be used for the new API with external
plugins. If you think it would add unnecessary overhead
to the panel then I'd absolutely agree that this addition
should be disregarded. It's vital to keep XFCE as
lightweight and fast as possible since it's one of the
main reasons for me to use it and love it.

But, (one more time) :-) since this specific call will
be made only when the user clicks on "add new item" or
"configure panel" or "whatever it'll be called" menu item,
I think it won't cause too much trouble.

And one more thing - I'm not trying to make you do my
work. :-) I definitely will implement the error
handling in the xkb plugin (so that the plugin shows
error messages to the user in the most user-friendly
way possible). This is my work and I'll do it. My
intention is to make XFCE panel even more user-friendly.

Once again, if you really think the overhead added by
this will be too much, then it's not worth it.

Best regards,
Alexander
