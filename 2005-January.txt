There's no way the panel can know about this. It's the same with the mail
checker and POP3. The real solution will probably involve making the plugins
separate processes.

Because you left me the option, I'm reassigning this ;-)

Hi Fabian,

I finally got around to installing your plugin and I must say I like it 
very much. Thanks!

Subject: [Bug 660]  New: Taskbar plugin causes panel to 'shake' when available space changes using "Expand to fill screen"
Message-ID: <20050107133704.049121F7045@espresso.foo-projects.org>

           Summary: Taskbar plugin causes panel to 'shake' when available
                    space changes using "Expand to fill screen"
           Product: Xfce Panel Plugins
           Version: unspecified
          Platform: PC
        OS/Version: Linux
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
          Priority: Medium
         Component: taskbar
        AssignedTo: xfce-goodies-dev at berlios.de
        ReportedBy: umkowa17 at cc.umanitoba.ca


When the taskbar plugin is in the panel with "Expand to fill screen" enabled,
and I do something that changes (increasing or decreasing) the available space,
such as adding an item to the panel, removing an icon from the panel, or
changing the amount of workspaces (with the graphical pager on the panel), the
panel will 'shake' (resizing itself?) for a variable amount of time (~1-5
seconds).  The xorg composite extension is disabled.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable the panel taskbar plugin
2. Enable its "Expand to fill screen" option"
3. Enable the System Buttons taskbar plugin
4. Toggle the option to "Hide" Button 2 (try a few times)

Actual Results:  
The panel resized itself many times before stopping.

Expected Results:  
A single resizing before halting

I'm using the AMD64 deb packages (4.2 RC3) in Ubuntu from
http://www.it-weber.net/debian/xfce4/

I downloaded, through the os-cillation installer, the xfce goodies. It proceeded
without incident. I added the notes goodie and tried to launch it. It failed --
nothing happened. I loaded the date time goodie, which I liked better than the
panel default time. So I removed the original date from the panel -- and the
panel disappeared. I logged out and in; no panel. I right clicked on the
desktop, launched xfce4-panel, and it came back. I saved the session, and logged
out. Logged back in, and it was back.

Reproducible: Always

I can reproduce it.

1. Add Notes to panel.
2. click on icon to launch. I tried both as "make sticky" and unselected "make
sticky."
3. I deleted the icon from the panel.
4. In about five seconds, the panel disappears.

Message-ID: <cs1n87$o8$1@sea.gmane.org>

Hello,

for Xfce 4.2, the bar of the systemload and netload plugins are (at 
least if the panel is in "small mode") too hight so that the panel 
increases height if the plugin is loaded.

I don't want this. I changed the code of my netload plugin. What about 
the system load plugin, which seems (well, maybe the netload plugin 
seems too but it isn't) to be unmaintained?


Regards,
Bernhard

I haven't heard anything from Riccardo for over a year now, so I guess
we can call the sysload plugin "unmaintained". Please go on and do the
required changes (and release a new version of the sysload plugin).

BTW: If you plan to release new versions for 4.2.0, do it until saturday
evening, so we can include them in the new goodies installer for 4.2.0.

Hmm, would it be an idea to do a quick review of all goodies before saturday
evening and do new releases if required?

*checks agenda* 

... damn, I won't really have much time, but I can have a quick look this 
evening.

I've been told that the weather plugin still crashes the panel when 
being removed, but I can't reproduce it here. Still, that makes the 
weather plugin a good candidate to look at.

In addition, I think that saturday evening is impossible for me to 
handle, so new releases need to happen until saturday morning (CET), 
which leaves about 32 hours for everyone that wants to check his plugin.

Hmm, I believe this is the notes plugin and I fixed that, but it does 
still need a release. I'll have a look anyway, thanks.

We've included that fix in the Debian Packages for Xfld already. 
Question is: New release or add the patch to the installer as well?

It's a crash bug, there is a fix, a new release seems the best solution.

If the system load plugin is unmaintained, you can take me new 
maintainer. I don't plan to do much work on the plugin, but I think it's 
better than no maintainer at all.

If nobody is against, I'll make the releases today.

I took the liberty of making a new file release for the weather plugin. 
It fixes a crash when removing and readding the plugin.

Bob, I hope you don't mind me doing this without asking you, but I 
really wanted to get this out before we release 4.2. My apologies.

I just made a new file release for the notes plugin. It fixes a crash

Jakob, my apologies for doing this without asking you first, but I

Hehe, even I forgot until now ;-) I really should write a bit of documentation
for the panel...

hi all,

  even if i haven't updated the plugin for some time now i'd
still like to play with it when i have the time to.
i've followed silently the mailing list and in the meantime
i got a degree and took a small vacation.
i know i've been quite busy but if you don't mind i'd keep
maintaining the systemload plugin..
well, of course patches are welcome and the developers can
update the plugin whenever they want to.

regards,

  riccardo

I'm very sorry. I hope you accept the height patch. Should I revert the 
AUTHORS and README and release a new version? Or would you like to do it.

no problem at all.. after all i've been too busy in the last months to
hack on the systemload plugin, it's my fault..
i hope i'll have time to play with it in the future.

i'll take care of the new release, thanks for the patch.

Message-ID: <20050117173652.6B5211F7041@espresso.foo-projects.org>

http://bugzilla.xfce.org/show_bug.cgi?id=699

           Summary: datetime->calendar behaviour different from clock-
                    >calendar/systray-calendar behaviour
           Product: Xfce Panel Plugins
           Version: unspecified
          Platform: PC
        OS/Version: Linux
            Status: NEW
          Severity: minor
          Priority: Medium
         Component: datetime
        AssignedTo: xfce-goodies-dev at berlios.de
        ReportedBy: Lasse at hardwareonline.dk


I am experiencing some inconsistency in the way the datetime plugin is working.
With both the calendar-systray icon, and with the time->calendar (clicking on time to get the calendar) 
I can double-click any day to add new appointments, but with datetime I cannot?

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add datetime plugin to panel
2. Add time plugin to panel
3. Click both to get calendar showing
4. Now try double-clicking on a date in the calendar that "time" is showing, works fine
5. Ditto for the datetime, nothing.....

Actual Results:  
Cannot add stuff to the datetime calendar

Expected Results:  
Have been able to add stuff to the calender that datetime is showing.

I have created a patch to fix the XMMS-Plugin problem with tooltips,
but I observed that it hasn't been updated in over a year, so I don't
know if the maintainer is around still or if this list is even active.
 The patch is attached.

Subject: xfce-weather-plugin 0.4.0 data storage path
Message-ID: <pan.2005.01.20.19.24.58.136402@trippelsdorf.de>

The xfce-weather-plugin 0.4.0 stores its data
in the .xfce4 directory. All other programs 
use the new default location .config/xfce4 .
The problem is that many people delete their 
.xfce4 directory when updating to 4.2..
When the .xfce4 directory does not exist, the weather
plugin will not work (displaying a network failure error).

Please change the storage directory to .config/xfce4 .

Thanks.
Markus

Strange as my data file already got stored in .config/xfce4. I've
changed the save code anyway, it now gets saved under .cache/xfce4. The
newest version is in cvs.

Maybe it's a good idea to do a new release even if the change is very 
small. It would be good to have no plugins using ~/.xfce4 anymore. What 
do you think?

Agree, i've added a new release. Though i'm still not sure this was
really a bug, as the path wasn't hard coded but used xfce_get_userdir()
to get the save directory.

That function is only there for backward compatibility and still uses 
~/.xfce4/. The xfce_resource_* functions should be used instead for 4.2.

Hi,

Now fixed.
However I couldn't close this feature request since I didn't have the

Summary: xfce4-mini command line and executing commands

Details: Ther's a problem with mini command plugin for xfce4.
For example typing :

kill `pidof xmms`

Will not kill xmms as `pidof xmms` will not be executed and thus not replaced by its return value - pid of xmms. It's not just pidof - nothing is executed when put in ` `

It wold be nice if you could use `commands` ( eg: kill
`pidof xmms` ) in the mini-command plugin.

When you untar xfce4-showdesktop-plugin-0.4.0.tar.gz it
creates a directory named "xfce4-showdesktop-plugin"
It would be better if this directory would be named
"xfce4-showdesktop-plugin-0.4.0" (with the version number).

Subject: [Bug 750]  New: Notes plugin does not use user-specified icon
Message-ID: <20050131220511.837311F7049@espresso.foo-projects.org>

           Summary: Notes plugin does not use user-specified icon
           Product: Xfce Panel Plugins
           Version: unspecified
          Platform: PC
        OS/Version: Linux
            Status: NEW
          Severity: trivial
          Priority: Medium
         Component: notes
        AssignedTo: xfce-goodies-dev at berlios.de
        ReportedBy: andrewski at fr.st


As of 4.2.0, the notes plugin no longer uses any user-specified icon.  The
default is supplied instead.

And while we're on the topic, is it possible (in future versions) to have the
notes plugin use an icon from the GTK theme?
