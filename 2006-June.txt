Subject: New goodies-dev Mailinglist
Message-ID: <20060602172353.d6bc7141.jannis@xfce.org>

Hi all,

Auke was so kind to create a new mailinglist on our server, so that we
no longer have to use the one on BerliOS. This is one of the last steps
of completely moving the Goodies project over to our own server
infrastructure.

You can subscribe to this new mailinglist on

  http://foo-projects.org/mailman/listinfo/goodies-dev

I hope all of you will follow the call so that we can drop (or at
least, clear) our BerliOS account in the near future.

Thanks,
Jannis

Message-ID: <44807A3E.3040604@xfce.org>

Is anyone going to make sure the berlios resources -- svn, website, 
mailing list and bug tracker -- are either locked or redirected to the 
appropriate xfce.org location? What would be a good time to start doing 
that?

Windows having an URGENT state causes the panel to flash the button belonging
to the window. This is great, however, for something that changes color twice
per second, CPU usage is rediculously high.

When my CPU runs at ~930MHz CPU usage is around 25% for xfce-panel and 10% for
xorg (added up).

Surely this could be brought back to at most 1% for xfce-panel. We're talking
about drawing a button twice per second here.

Reproducible: Always

If you have any ideas about why it is taking so much CPU or how it could be
reduced, please let me know.

Ok, sorry to hijack this thread. Having a double repository is bad, so 
if people are starting to use the new SVN, we should do something with 
the old one...

I wonder if removing the SVN feature from the feature list in the 
berlios admin area will remove the repository as well. Does anyone know? 
Alternatively, I could svn remove everything. Any better options to 
prevent double work?

	Jasper

Removing everything first should be ok. An we can still disable the SVN
feature afterwards.

THe wavelan plugin does not work for all cards, saying there is no device found
for most.

It seems to work best for ipw2200 based cards. 

I will investigate this problem soon.

If you have a working configuration please post you kernel version, card, and
driver version here so I can try and spot any patterns. 

Also please step forward if you have any suggestions about a possible cause.

Subject: User account requests
Message-ID: <20060605175845.ba075d9e.jannis@xfce.org>

Hi all,

this message only is for those who haven't requested a user account
on http://foo-projects.org/node/3 so far, but who need access to the
goodies SVN in whatever way:

Please enter something descriptive (like e.g. the goodie you're
working on) into the "Comments" field, if possible. Also enter whether
you are a developer or translator.

We can hardly check anyone in detail. The fact that we removed most
people from the project on BerliOS makes it even harder as we can't
compare against an existing list of developers.

This also is important because all developers will get Wiki access for
their goodie's page. It would be nice to be able to filter out
developers at the time they register.

Thanks in advance,
Jannis

All other values for the weather plugin's configuration (location code, etc.)
are saved and reloaded when I restart Xfce except for the Measurement Unit
value.

I am using I am using the weather plugin 0.5, Xfce 4.4Beta, GTK+ 2.6.7, CentOS
4.3, kernel 2.6.9-34.EL.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Change the Measurement Value from Metric to Imperial
2. Restart Xfce
3. The Measurement Value is back to Metric




Someone mentioned this problem in #XFCE earlier today, and another user pointed
out that the cause of the problem is a misspelling of "celcius" on line 315 of
plugin.c. Changing "celsius" to "celcius" fixes the problem.

According to 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius

celsius is written with "S". There must be another place in the source where it
falsely is written with "C" in the middle.

I've just read a blog entry on planet Gnome about the new DnD in their pager,
they finally implemented support for DnD inside the pager but they also added
support for DnDing a taskbar entry directly in the pager. I don't know if it's
very useful but it could avoid some "in Gnome i could ... but in Xfce i can't
..." reports

Reproducible: Always

           Summary: clipman crashes noisily when I copy binary junk
           Product: Xfce Panel Plugins
           Version: unspecified
          Platform: PC (x86)
        OS/Version: Linux
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
          Priority: Medium
         Component: clipman
        AssignedTo: xfce-goodies-dev at berlios.de
        ReportedBy: dooglus at gmail.com


User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.4)
Gecko/20060406 Firefox/1.5.0.4 (Debian-1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.4-1)
Build Identifier: 0.6-1

I copied some random binary junk into my clipboard using GNU Emacs.  The
clipman plugin started using all my CPU and writing:

  (xfce4-clipman-plugin:22816): Gdk-WARNING **: Error converting selection from
UTF8_STRING

over and over again into my session logfile.  After writing half a gigabyte of
such lines I killed it, because my disk was about to run out of space.

There's no guarantee that the contents of the clipboard are going to be a valid
UTF8 string, so if clipman isn't able to convert the string on its first
attempt shouldn't it give up trying?

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
When it happened, I had used dd to write the first few sectors of a reiserfs
disk partition to a file, then visited that file in GNU Emacs, and then deleted
large parts of the file using Emacs.  I have x-select-enable-clipboard set to t
in Emacs, so whenever I 'kill' regions of the buffer, they get sent to the
clipboard.

I just counted them; clipman wrote the following string 4,943,074 times before
I killed it.  That's too many error messages!  The file I was editing was only
512k bytes long, so this is more than one message per byte in the file.  I
would guess clipman was in an infinite loop:

  "(xfce4-clipman-plugin:22816): Gdk-WARNING **: Error converting selection
from UTF8_STRING"

I've changed this code in svn, but i looks more like a glib problem. Maybe it's
indeed better to drop the content of the clip if we can't make it utf8, I'll
change this.

The problem is you can only use the latest svn version if you also have
libxfcegui4 from trunk, so you probably have to wait for beta 2.

I'm unable to repreduce this problem, but can you try the new version please?
It should work with all the 4.4 versions.

I tried that version but still get the same problem.

I made a 1-byte file containing just character 0300 (octal), copied that using
Emacs, and clipman started printing it's error message over and over again.

I don't know how to run clipman so that I can see its output other than by
running xfce4 inside a FreeNX session.  Is there another way, so that I can run
FreeNX out of the equation?  ~/.xsession-errors has "...Too much output,
ignoring rest..." at the end of it, so I can't watch that.  Is there some way
of invoking clipman from the command line and getting it to run properly?

Here's a backtrace:

The error message is displayed each time clipman_check() calls
gtk_clipboard_wait_for_text (defaultClip) - which it does regularly, using a
timer.
