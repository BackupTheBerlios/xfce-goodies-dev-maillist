&gt;<i> Hello :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Jasper Huijsmans napisa&#322;(a):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * I think what we need most is people checking out SVN and report * I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't now if xfprint and xfce4-appfinder need any work. Danny is busy 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> porting xfce4-mixer to the new panel framework. The mailwatch plugin 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seems to work very well.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problems. It needs to work in as many situations as possible.
</I>&gt;<i> well here I found an error just lately and I'm trying to fix it, but 
</I>&gt;<i> can't seem to do it the right way.
</I>&gt;<i> I've got the panel set up in vertical and the mixer doesn't display 
</I>&gt;<i> right, it's just a thin horizontal line with a button on the side, 
</I>&gt;<i> though I can control the sound level by middle-scroll.
</I>
I leave that one for Danny to fix.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As for the Panel Actions, I think it would be good to enable an command 
</I>&gt;<i> input box in it, so to allow the user to set an action on screen-lock, 
</I>&gt;<i> logout, reboot and halt.
</I>&gt;<i> i.e. I don't use sudo, and built my own type of a &quot;user shutdown system&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> so I'd like to set the action performed by the reboot/halt command 
</I>&gt;<i> within the settings, though maybe it's just me, and people like me 
</I>&gt;<i> should stick to the code ;]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Hmm. Logout is performed by the session manager. I don't really want to 
add special purpose code to the panel. I don't remember if the session 
manager allows custom shutdown commands.

For the screensaver the panel uses the xflock4 script. It might be 
easier to modify that instead.

&gt;<i> About the clock, I think it would be good to be able to set the font, 
</I>&gt;<i> the clock is displayed with. Cause the LED option is too big, and the 
</I>&gt;<i> number's option is too small (I use 1280x1024 screen size).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
The clock could be improved a lot, but I don't think I will have the 
time to work on it. I would take a patch for this one, if someone else 
were to write it.

Other possible improvements: support for different time zones, support 
for showing the date and support for user-defined formats (like the 
date-time plugin). The dialog must remain simple though, so that will be 
a bit of a challenge ;-)

&gt;<i> Again about the panel, I was thinking of another option to display 
</I>&gt;<i> multicommand activators. Right now there's an arrow informing of the 
</I>&gt;<i> possibility to show a small menu of other available commands.
</I>&gt;<i> I was thinking of an option to hide the arrow (making the whole icon 
</I>&gt;<i> smaller, and thus giving more space in the panel for others), and enable 
</I>&gt;<i> the same function by middle clicking on the icon (AFAIK it doesn't do 
</I>&gt;<i> anything right now) and maybe just putting a small mark on the icon 
</I>&gt;<i> telling that there is a menu.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Not before 4.4 I think. Middle click is not a very convenient way to 
access the menu though. I already does pop up the menu if you hold the 
left mouse button, so maybe that would be enough?

Other ideas for the launcher include putting the last-used item on the 
panel (there's even a patch for that), but I think I will leave that 
until after 4.4 to decide.

&gt;&gt;<i> Translations
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ============
</I>&gt;<i> so I guess somebody is already taking care of the Polish translation,
</I>&gt;<i> but if any help would be needed on this, I'll be glad to help.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
You could always join the xfce-i18n mailing list are ask the current 
Polish translator directly if he needs any help.

&gt;&gt;<i> Website
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> =======
</I>&gt;<i> Do You need any mirrors? I'm currently running my own server with some 
</I>&gt;<i> of the standard services (wftpd,apache,exim,php) and a 1MBit limitless 
</I>&gt;<i> connection, so I could do for a mirror, if not the whole page, maybe at 
</I>&gt;<i> least the ftp sections, though I'd preffer http dir's instead of anon ftp.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Mirrors for source tarballs and binary packages are always welcome. You 
probably want to wait for at least the beta releases with that though. 
There's no need to mirror the web site itself, I think.

&gt;<i> Other than those, I'm completely satisfied with xfce svn as of friday :)
</I>&gt;<i> I try to keep up doing svn builds once a week or two.
</I>
Thanks!

	Jasper
