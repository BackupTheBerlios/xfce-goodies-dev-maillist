<PRE>Hello :)

Jasper Huijsmans napisa&#322;(a):
&gt;<i> * I think what we need most is people checking out SVN and report 
</I>&gt;<i> * I don't now if xfprint and xfce4-appfinder need any work. Danny is 
</I>&gt;<i> busy porting xfce4-mixer to the new panel framework. The mailwatch 
</I>&gt;<i> plugin seems to work very well.
</I>&gt;<i> problems. It needs to work in as many situations as possible.
</I>well here I found an error just lately and I'm trying to fix it, but 
can't seem to do it the right way.
I've got the panel set up in vertical and the mixer doesn't display 
right, it's just a thin horizontal line with a button on the side, 
though I can control the sound level by middle-scroll.

As for the Panel Actions, I think it would be good to enable an command 
input box in it, so to allow the user to set an action on screen-lock, 
logout, reboot and halt.
i.e. I don't use sudo, and built my own type of a &quot;user shutdown system&quot;
so I'd like to set the action performed by the reboot/halt command 
within the settings, though maybe it's just me, and people like me 
should stick to the code ;]

About the clock, I think it would be good to be able to set the font, 
the clock is displayed with. Cause the LED option is too big, and the 
number's option is too small (I use 1280x1024 screen size).

Again about the panel, I was thinking of another option to display 
multicommand activators. Right now there's an arrow informing of the 
possibility to show a small menu of other available commands.
I was thinking of an option to hide the arrow (making the whole icon 
smaller, and thus giving more space in the panel for others), and enable 
the same function by middle clicking on the icon (AFAIK it doesn't do 
anything right now) and maybe just putting a small mark on the icon 
telling that there is a menu.

&gt;<i> Translations
</I>&gt;<i> ============
</I>so I guess somebody is already taking care of the Polish translation,
but if any help would be needed on this, I'll be glad to help.

&gt;<i> Website
</I>&gt;<i> =======
</I>Do You need any mirrors? I'm currently running my own server with some 
of the standard services (wftpd,apache,exim,php) and a 1MBit limitless 
connection, so I could do for a mirror, if not the whole page, maybe at 
least the ftp sections, though I'd preffer http dir's instead of anon ftp.

Other than those, I'm completely satisfied with xfce svn as of friday :)
I try to keep up doing svn builds once a week or two.
