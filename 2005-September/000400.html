<PRE>Hi again.
Just a little bug rep. on the cpugraph-plugin-szifted
It isn't working 100% fine and eventually crashes the panel as often as 
the seti-option does (or even more).
I know this is because of the file /tmp/top.lista not being created in 
time for the plugin to read it properly. For now as a temporary fix I 
added a usleep(300); - at line 312 - after the command execution.
But it doesn't stop the crashes, makes them much less often - that's for 
sure.
An ideal option would be to use an exec function that would wait for the 
top process to finish it's scan, but as I said, I'm not much of a coder 
and don't know, and can't find nothing about such a function ;]
(the <A HREF="http://szift.org/xfce/xfce4-cpugraph-plugin-szifted.tar.bz2">http://szift.org/xfce/xfce4-cpugraph-plugin-szifted.tar.bz2</A> has 
been updated by the above)

As a extra tip, as - as ussual - I'm not giving ANY warranty that this 
will work great, I'd recommend making a backup of the ~/.config 
directory before launching the plugins, because when the panel crashes, 
once a while it loses it's settings, and it can be a pain to set 
everything back up again.
But that happened just once or twice troughout all the tests I've made 
(read this as aLOT) so don't worry too much.
