<PRE>Hi all,

I'd like to start a discussion about the goodies project, to see if 
there are things that could be improved.

Specifically I'd like to hear your opinion on the following items:

- Move SVN to Xfce server(s). Auke is doing a great job managing our 
server and more and more subprojects are being hosted there as well 
(XFC, thunar, xfmedia, pyxfce,...).

- Management and coordination. Currently there basically is none. I 
thought it might be good if a few goodies developers would become some 
sort of release team and make coordinated releases of all plugins, check 
every once in a while if maintainers are becoming inactive, approve the 
addition of new developers, etc.

- Website. I thought for a project like this with many independent 
subprojects it might be better to use some sort of wiki. That would make 
it easier, I think, for maintainers to keep the information about their 
program up-to-date. Every plugin could have a small project page with: 
name, author(s), contact information, screenshot(s), link to download 
latest version, etc.
Maybe it would be nice to have a small team of developers to keep the 
general content of the website up-to-date.

- Communication. Could this be improved? For instance, I think it is not 
always clear to users that xfce-goodies is a vital part of Xfce to get 
the full Xfce Experience (TM). Also, I'm not sure it is clear enough for 
potential developers that the project is open to everyone.

- Anything else about the project you would like to see different?


Soon, I'll be switching SVN trunk to the new panel framework I have been 
developing. All plugins will have to be ported (should not be too hard 
to do), so this might also be a good opportunity to beta-test other 
changes in the project.

It is your project, so tell me what you think.

cheers,
	Jasper
