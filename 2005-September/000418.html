&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to start a discussion about the goodies project, to see if 
</I>&gt;<i> there are things that could be improved.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Specifically I'd like to hear your opinion on the following items:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Move SVN to Xfce server(s). Auke is doing a great job managing our 
</I>&gt;<i> server and more and more subprojects are being hosted there as well 
</I>&gt;<i> (XFC, thunar, xfmedia, pyxfce,...).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>No prob for me, since we are already using svn.

&gt;<i> - Management and coordination. Currently there basically is none. I 
</I>&gt;<i> thought it might be good if a few goodies developers would become some 
</I>&gt;<i> sort of release team and make coordinated releases of all plugins, check 
</I>&gt;<i> every once in a while if maintainers are becoming inactive, approve the 
</I>&gt;<i> addition of new developers, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Website. I thought for a project like this with many independent 
</I>&gt;<i> subprojects it might be better to use some sort of wiki. That would make 
</I>&gt;<i> it easier, I think, for maintainers to keep the information about their 
</I>&gt;<i> program up-to-date. Every plugin could have a small project page with: 
</I>&gt;<i> name, author(s), contact information, screenshot(s), link to download 
</I>&gt;<i> latest version, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe it would be nice to have a small team of developers to keep the 
</I>&gt;<i> general content of the website up-to-date.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>This remeber me the idea of creating directory.xfce.org, a site with all xfce-related stuff. But this never comes really alive yet.
I also think that the organisation can be improved, and something like news for every plugin who added/updated would be a good starting point I think.
Also using a wiki for that is perhaps a good idea, or perhaps not if for example we want a news system written by 2 or 3 people. 
At least, this could (must?) be discussed. 

&gt;<i> - Communication. Could this be improved? For instance, I think it is not 
</I>&gt;<i> always clear to users that xfce-goodies is a vital part of Xfce to get 
</I>&gt;<i> the full Xfce Experience (TM). Also, I'm not sure it is clear enough for 
</I>&gt;<i> potential developers that the project is open to everyone.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Perhaps adding a link called &quot;how to contribute&quot; and an how-to for that can do the trick.

&gt;<i> - Anything else about the project you would like to see different?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Hmm, perhaps having some guys who can test the plugin before releasing them to ensure quality can be good too (wa spoke of that for directory.xfce.org). But we can also live without.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Soon, I'll be switching SVN trunk to the new panel framework I have been 
</I>&gt;<i> developing. All plugins will have to be ported (should not be too hard 
</I>&gt;<i> to do), so this might also be a good opportunity to beta-test other 
</I>&gt;<i> changes in the project.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Mine just don't work, but that's another problem :-).

&gt;<i> It is your project, so tell me what you think.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> 	Jasper
</I>&gt;<i>
