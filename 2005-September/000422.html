<PRE>	Hi:

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Management and coordination. Currently there basically is none. I 
</I>&gt;<i> thought it might be good if a few goodies developers would become
</I>&gt;<i> some sort of release team and make coordinated releases of all
</I>&gt;<i> plugins, check every once in a while if maintainers are becoming
</I>&gt;<i> inactive, approve the addition of new developers, etc.
</I>
	Sounds good. 

	There is a question I think it is important for the reputation
of xfce. If some goodies are to be coordinately released, I think that
they should be goodies stable enough. That is, we should avoid
include those projects with some bugs or in an unstable state. If some
projects are coordinately released, they should be &quot;the best&quot; ones (it
sounds really weird) and they should go into the goodies package that
users can download.

	I know it sounds weird, because it implies to decide what
project is good and what project is &quot;not so good&quot; ... but it is a kind
of quality control that improves xfce quality and reputation.

	The truth is that I am not completely sure about that, but I
send you my thoughts ...

&gt;<i> about their program up-to-date. Every plugin could have a small
</I>&gt;<i> project page with: name, author(s), contact information,
</I>&gt;<i> screenshot(s), link to download latest version, etc.
</I>
	I completely agree!

&gt;<i> Maybe it would be nice to have a small team of developers to keep the 
</I>&gt;<i> general content of the website up-to-date.
</I>
	Of course.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Communication. Could this be improved? For instance, I think it is
</I>&gt;<i> not always clear to users that xfce-goodies is a vital part of Xfce
</I>&gt;<i> to get the full Xfce Experience (TM). Also, I'm not sure it is clear
</I>&gt;<i> enough for potential developers that the project is open to everyone.
</I>
	Related to the first part, I think it has to be promoted from
the xfce site. That is, it is important to drive users from xfce to
xfce-goodies.

	Related to the second part, I think it is obvious. It is open
source, hence it is open to everybody ...

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Anything else about the project you would like to see different?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
	Related to the previous question. I think goodies web site is a
bit isolated from the xfce site. For example, berlios projects show a
different GUI, hence users think they are in a completely different
site, not &quot;officially&quot; related to the XFCE site. I think it would be
good to use similar GUI's, or even use the same host.

	It is important to stress that berlios goodies are the
&quot;official&quot; goodies for Xfce. Another possibility would be to insert
links to goodies project in xfce help pages, documentation, etc...

cheers

Xavier
