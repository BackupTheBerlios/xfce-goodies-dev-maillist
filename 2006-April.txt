No, it doesn't work with Xfce4-panel 4.4.

Subject: ANNOUNCE: Verve Plugin 0.3.0 Released
Message-ID: <20060403213811.94699cac.jannis@xfce.org>

Hey all,

I am pleased to announce the third release of my panel command line
plugin. It has at least one cool new feature: Grabbing the focus through
a shell command (which can e.g. be connected to a keyboard shortcut).

But first of all we have a few bug fixes:

  * If you enter a command twice, the last one is not added to the
    command history anymore (fixes bug #6900). This avoids having a
    history looking like this:
    
      xfce4-appfinder
      thunar
      thunar
      thunar

    Instead, this would now look like this:

      xfce4-appfinder
      thunar

    This makes browsing the history faster.

  * Shell errors, which e.g. occured when entering a single quote (')
    no longer crash the plugin (bug #6663). 

  * Commands from the history now appear in the auto-completion results.

Now for the new features:

  * Terminal startup: You can now run commands in your favourite
    terminal emulator by holding down the CTRL key while pressing ENTER
    to execute your input. In future Versions of Xfce (>= 4.4) you can
    adjust your preferred terminal emulator in the "Preferred
    Applications" section of the MCS manager.

  * Focus grabbing: There's now a helper script (written in Python)
    which makes it possible to let Verve grab the focus. It's called
    "verve-focus" and is copied to $(bindir) (e.g. /usr/local/bin)
    during the installation. You'll need D-BUS bindings for Python in
    order to make use of it. 

    Note that you can easily assign a keyboard shortcut for Verve now.
    Just add an entry to the shorcut or keyboard plugin in the MCS
    manager to run verve-focus. 

    After running the script, Verve should start to flash. You can stop
    this by either simply typing what you wanted to type, by pressing
    an unimportant key like SHIFT or by clicking into the input field
    with the first or second mouse button.

  * org.xfce.RunDialog D-BUS service: Verve now supports this service
    which can be used as a backend for xfrun4 Xfce >= 4.4. xfrun4 will
    check for a running org.xfce.RunDialog service and call the
    first one available instead of popping up the well-known dialog
    window.

That's it. 

ChangeLog is available on

------- Comment #1 from sasoiliev at mamul.org  2006-04-07 15:47 UTC -------
The plugin does not handle the XKB configuration runtime changes. This is a
known issue and will be fixed in some version in the future.

a sidenote: Freezing the panel should require just restarting the panel itself,
not X.

I wonder what makes you call setxkbmap in order to switch layouts? I mean, the
common setup should be to configure XKB layouts through XF86Config/xorg.conf or
by running setxkbmap on X startup and then switch layouts through a keyboard
shortcut (e.g. Alt-Shift).

At one point, I had used setxkbmap to set the XKB layout to my secondary layout
in my ~/.bashrc, so that it would be loaded when X started.  This is when I had
noticed this bug.

I've tried some of the plugins but no one seemed to work with svn versions

Is there any API freeze delay?

Daichi Kawahata has posted a list of goodies, supporting the Xfce 4.4
panel plugin interface. This list is right here:

I think Jasper should answer this.

People should really port their plugins as soon as possible, since we 
are close to a first 4.4 beta release. I made a couple of ports, mostly 
as an example, but I don't have enough time do do this myself.

The idea of the plugins always was that 'third-party developers' (read: 
other people than me) would write, develop and maintain them. However, 
there has not been a lot of discussion on this list I'm afraid, so I can 
only presume that many plugin writers are just as busy as I am :(

Hi Nick,

Please take a look at the attached patch which enables
working i18n (Japanese translations incl.).

Also, the clip manager plugin crashes on exit, check
the attached stack trace log as well. My build environment
was GTK+ 2.9.0, GLib 2.11.0, gcc 4.0.1 on IRIX 6.5.22m.

Regards,

Fixed a couple of bugs (including yours Daichi), removed colors, new pref.
dialog.
I've also added tooltips to the pref. dialog, can you guys check it?
Probably some corrections needed!

I tought, it would be nice to have the borders of windows shown when i move the
mouse over the correspondig buttons on the taskbar. This should look just like
alt-tab does. I'm using the ubuntu-breezy debs and dunno, if alt-tab still has
that feature.
The reason for this is, that i recognize windows by there size and position
much faster than by their name, which i would have to read, interpret and so
on. Not that i'm an analphabet (i'm typing, eh?). But if i alt-tab-cycle
through lots of terminals i usually know, where which session was located...
but am to lazy to parse the whole user at machine:/dir string which even doesn't
reveal the program running in the session.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Move mouse over taskbar
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
nothin

Expected Results:  
Frames of windows apperaing

so you can set up two taskbars for example, where one displays all normal
windows, and one shows only minimized windows. i used sth like that in my fvwm
setup and i think it would be a nice addition. the "icon box" plugin can show
only minimized apps, but i like the view of the taskbar better.

perhaps a combobox "show window type" with the options "only minimized
windows", "no minimized windows" and "all windows" in the taskbar plugin
preferences.

Hi!

Because my Thinkpad 600e has this annoying battery problem I need
something that warns me as soon as my battery is fully charged, to not
overcharge it. I had once written a small python-script. But because the
battery-plugin already warns you about almost-empty batteries, I had the
idea to now patch it for this purpose. I actually just did a copy &
paste & :s/low/full/g, so it's nothing special ;)

I'm not sure how many Xfce users will need it. I think most laptops
prevent the battery from being overcharged. But it won't harm anyone to
give the users the option to be warned. So you are free to use this
patch if you want to ;)

Greetings!

(Officially this is a patch for libxfcegui4)

There is no space between the taskbar icon and the label. This may
look a bit confusing when the icon has a black border. This patch added
some cell space in the table when the taskbar labels are enabled.

I think the time has come to update the goodies to the new panel. I'd
like to port some of them (i.e. the CPU graph plugin) to Solaris for
Xfce 4.4.0. Jasper has done the work for several plugins already. Now
its time to merge that work into trunk.

What do you think?

Yes, this is really needed.

Let me be honest. I have a feeling that several plugins are rather 
unmaintained at the moment. Plugins for which there is no indication 
that they are being ported now, probably will not be ported before the 
release unless someone else does the work.

So we (read: you ;-) can probably start porting the missing plugins, 
unless the maintainer indicates they are working on it.

Does someone have a reasonably up-to-date list of ported plugins? 
Nicolas perhaps?

I started to do a full rewrite of the i8k plugin to add acpi support and 
allow for it to be easily extended to other archs... but i'm not close 
to finishing it at the moment and have another project that has all my 
attention for the next month. If someone is willing to port it i'd be 
very grateful.

  Here's a message that was prevoiously sent to this list, it contains a 
table of plugins and their status.

  Let me mention what I have on my side: I maintain the xmms and timer 
plugins. xmms was ported to 4.4 months ago, and timer was written for 4.4 
already. There was a recent patch proposed for the xmms plugin, I'll check 
if I have time to apply it soon (I'll be very busy until the end of next 
week).

xfce4-teatime-plugin(compiles, but doesn't seem to work..., how does it work??? :) )


I've tested all the packages who were marked as not done-untested.
I've also added some comment for some of them. (Perhaps should I add some of them in the bug database???)

Good night, (assuming it makes also night for you)

This also reminds me of the default clock plugin.  I mostly rewrote it
to have datetime-like features, and I remember someone (Nick?) added
multi-timezone support to what I did, though I don't know where that
patch is offhand.

The only gripe I recall is that it was missing the analog and LED modes,
which shouldn't be too hard to add back in.  So...

I have my patch, without the multi-timezone stuff.  Does anyone know
where the multi-timezone patch is?  I don't mind cleaning it up and
adding the analog and LED stuff.

	Hello:

	I would like to ask the developer of xfce4-diskperf-plugin to
port it to FreeBSD.

	I tried to port it to FreeBSD, but system functions are
different from NetBSD ones that are on the source code.

cheers

If i'm not wrong those in the TESTED lista were tested with the new
xfce4-panel right? Where is that xfce4-screenshooter from? I got the last
svn version and it complains with :

checking for XFCE4_PANEL... configure: error: Package requirements (
xfce4-panel-1.0 >= 0.10.1) were not met:

No package 'xfce4-panel-1.0' found

Message-ID: <200604191712.28087.rstmp@iinet.com.au>

Thanks Jasper for your time spent on porting genmon and diskperf.
Though genmon is OK on my system with Xfce 4.3.90.1 (Xfce 4.4 beta 1), I can't 
get diskperf to work at all. I even don't have the tooltips and if I add a 
second instance of the plugin, when restarting the panel the 2nd instance is 
gone.
Has anyone got this plugin working? Anyway, I'll try to have a look in the 
code sometimes during the next couple of weeks.

Besides, I also installed Jasper's ports of systemload, netload and 
weatherupdate: all of them seem to be fine so far.

Cheers,
Roger Seguin

Definitely. Rather difficult now to know which are available.

For example has somebody ported trigger-launcher
already to 4.4?

Maybe we should drop this one. I'm not sure whether Verve covers all
functionality already, but I think so. So having two plugins providing
the same might be confusing.

Perhaps we can set up a wiki page for this and enter all plugins to
have a better overview? xfcewiki.org seems to be down, but we could also
use the Thunar wiki temporarily, I think. What do you think, Benny?

I can setup a wiki for xfce goodies on xfce.org (goodies.xfce.org,
Auke?) if you want, I just need to adjust the templates I created for
the thunar wiki. Adding Xfce panel stuff to the thunar wiki doesn't make
much sense IMHO.

Yeah, would just have been a temporary solution in order to get a fast
overview. Anyway, the Wiki you are using for Thunar looks quite good, so
I vote for using it. It even ships RSS feeds, yay!

It's a customized DokuWiki. If you talk to Auke/Olivier about setting up
goodies.xfce.org, and the provider of the current wiki, we can move that
stuff to mocha.

It was just a list of ported plugins, and this one was. But now we can for example mark it as deprecated(in favour of the verve-plguin), yes.

If I understand well; this would just be a page where we can see a list of the ported plugins, isn't it?
If you want, I can post such a page on the berlios website, with my current list. I think she's quite complete now.
(but igree that a wiki would be the best way to di this, since every body is able to edit the page easily)

Hm, yeah, the most important thing is to have get an overview now.
Anyway, it would be cool to have a Wiki and RSS feeds to notify users
of changes made to the Goodies. The DokuWiki system Benny is using
provides both. Auke is going to create goodies.xfce.org for us next
week so we can set it up.

After that we could slowly drop the BerliOS website, hopefully. It's
just too slow and down too often. After 4.4 we will could import the
goodies repository into the Xfce SVN and also create DokuWiki accounts
for all participating developers, translators and so forth.

Jannis

Hi,

I would like to ask a project admin to add the missing categories for
xfce-goodies bug tracker. Currently only verve, battery, systemload

I just browsed the goodies member list - you have an account, don't
you? You can create categories on your own. Anyway, if there are
problems, just tell me and I will do it.

I don't who had these category, and in fact I didn't knew that such category was existing before your mail.
Anyway, I think that creating a new category for each plugin would be too much. I think it would be better
to create 4 category:
a)Panel plugin
b)File manager plugin
c)applications
d)artwork

We can create groups with that, but there should be one category per
product.

Hi everyone.

I just wanna say that i've finished to update the current svn on Berlios. I've added in the ports of the plugins that Jasper made some time ago.
Note that I've tested them all and they are working on my system. 
Note that I also had to update the ./autogen.sh script for most of them in order to use the xfce-dev-tools.
I think I will wait for xfce4.4 being out before I post the packages on Berlios.

It would in my opinion be better to put them up /somewhere/ now so that
packagers can upload 4.4 to distributions with working plugins for
testing.

Probably the best solution would be tu use the ftp we have...ok, I'm working on it.

clipman-plugin tarballs seems to be shipped with ./autogen.sh already
done, so Makefile is generated with static path etc... There's also .svn
folder in the tarball.

Other ones haven't been cleaned:

xfce4-cpugraph-plugin
xfce4-genmon-plugin
xfce4-minicmd-plugin

and xfce4-diskperf-plugin seems to have wrong version (0.2 after 1.6 ?
shouldn't be 2.0 ?)

Maybe there are others, I'll let you know, as I'm packaging them all.

Hi,

I have xfce4-xfapplet-plugin 0.1.0 packaged and ready to be uploaded, but I
can't figure out how to create a new package on BerliOS to release the file
neither how to upload it to the FTP. Can anyone help? I'll probably be on #xfce
the next hours.

Regards,
Adriano

In order to upload on the ftp:
scp  username at shell.berlios.de:/home/groups/ftp/pub/xfce-goodies/directory/package.tar.bz2

On Berlios: 
you must upload the files in ftp://ftp.berlios.de/incoming
and then create a new package version.

This is the problem, there's no package 'xfce4-xfapplet-plugin' yet to create a
new version and I don't know how to create it.

log into berlios: https://developer.berlios.de/account/login.php
then go to the xfce-goodies project page, then Admin. of the Project (on the left side) then Edit/Release Files. (search for the string if you don't find the link).
I've created the package and the version 0.1 for you.

The group 'xfce-goodies' doesn't have permission to write to the directories
under xfce-goodies FTP, so the above doesn't work.

xfce4-cpugraph-plugin, xfce4-genmon-plugin andxfce4-minicmd-plugin ship
config.status file. (and maybe others but I don't really know autotools)

And xfce4-weather-plugin has config.status too. It's a problem for
debian packaging because it prevents the system to run configure, trying
to run make only (and there is no Makefile at this time).

I've just uploaded xfce4-xfapplet-plugin to BerliOS. Would you mind checking if
it is clean as you expect it to be and doesn't brake Debian build? As a Debian
user myself, it really matters to me that it can be packaged just fine for
Debian.

Regards,
Adriano
