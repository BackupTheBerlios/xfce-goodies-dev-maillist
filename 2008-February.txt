Subject: xfce4-mixer : free space in the panel, change right-click behaviour ?
Message-ID: <15181860.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hi,
i'm using this plugin and feel that it takes too much space in the panel
(the gnome equivalent
was neat, but i'm trying to get rid of those applets).


so to get closer i just suppressed the volume icon (mixer properties should
be
accessed by context-menu, right-click on the tiny slider), and disabled the
middle and right
click behaviour (to get access to the context menu).


The only thing one would object is that there's nothing telling this slider
is to change sound...
But that way, it frees a lot of space in the panel.


The modifs i did are simply comment gtk_widget_show (mixer->box); in
plugin.c and return FALSE for
middle and right clicks in xfce-mixer-slider-tiny.c :


if (b->button == 1) {
	sy = widget->allocation.height;
	if (sy != 0) {
		y = (sy + 2 - y) * 100 / sy;
		if (y <= 0) y = 0;
	} else y = 0;
} else {
	return FALSE;
}


And here's what it looks like :
